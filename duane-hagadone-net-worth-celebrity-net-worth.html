After dropping out of college, Duane Hagedone began working for his father's newspaper and eventually became the owner of that publication as well as many others. He is the Head of the Hagedorn Corporation, a very successful company with branches dedicated to publishing, hospitality, and real estate. Duane Hagadone was born in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, in 1932, and started several small businesses as a kid, mostly mowing lawns and doing landscaping. At the age of eleven, he began delivering papers for the "Coeur d'Alene Press", a local paper published by his father. Though Hagadone enrolled in the University of Idaho, he soon left to take a job with the newspaper.</p><p>He started by selling subscriptions before moving on to classified ads and advertising. Hagadone approached the Scripps Company to ask for publishing backing after the death of his father and he quickly turned the paper into the company's biggest success. In 1976, Hagadone bought that paper and several others and created the Hagadone Corporation. Today, he has more than a dozen corporate holdings, including the Hagadone Newspaper Group, Coeur d'Alene Resort, Boardwalk Marina, Silver Beach Marina, and Quicksilver Photography. He is the recipient of several awards, including 2004's Horatio Alger Award and 2006's Idaho Business Leader of the Year. Hagadone owned a 64,000 square foot estate in Palm Desert, California, one of the largest in the area and a 164-foot yacht named "Lady Lola" that boasts its own helipads, golf course, and submarine.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6o8HSoqWeq6Oisq97w66Yp51dna6orcOopZ5lnprBbsPOq6uhZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-niko-goodrum-dating-niko-goodrum-s-girlfriend-exes.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Who is Niko Goodrum Dating Niko Goodrum's Girlfriend &amp;amp; Exes</span></a>
