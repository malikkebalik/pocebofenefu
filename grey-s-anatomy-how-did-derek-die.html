While Meredith Grey, played by Ellen Pompeo, is the main focus of the series, it is an ensemble series and features a large supporting cast of talented performers.</p><p id=par-4_30>Far from just following the events in Meredith and her friends’ professional lives, the show digs deep into the personal lives and stories of nearly every character in the series.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-5_41>Grey’s Anatomy has been honored many times by critics over the years and has been nominated for 25 Primetime Emmy Awards. Many of the show’s actors have also been nominated for awards individually, including Katherine Heigl, Pompeo, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Patrick Dempsey</a>.</p><p id=par-6_22>The latter rose to fame acting in Grey’s Anatomy, and eventually became one of the most popular characters in the show’s history.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-derek-shepherd-is-a-fan-favorite-grey-s-anatomy-character>Derek Shepherd is a fan-favorite Grey’s Anatomy’ character&nbsp;</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-2></figure><p id=par-7_42>Dempsey was best known for acting in guest roles in various television shows when he was cast on Grey’s Anatomy.

Over the years, Derek develops a strong affinity for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Meredith Grey</a>, and the two form a tight bond that turns romantic.</p><p id=par-9_49>Although Meredith and Derek have a number of trials and tribulations over the years, they eventually get married and begin raising their three children together.
