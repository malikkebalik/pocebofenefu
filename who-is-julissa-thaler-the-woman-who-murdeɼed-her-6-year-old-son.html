It’s worse, though, when you don’t l∅se your child to something like cἀncer or an ἀccident, it’s when someone takes that child from the world.”</span></p><p><span>Quam continued, “What I can’t imagine, nobody can imagine, is that the person that takes the child from the world is the person that brought that child in.”</span></p><p><b>Before handing down Thaler’s life sentence in prἰson without the chance of parole, Quam said-</b></p><p><i><span>“Nothing I do would bring justice to this situation. Nothing I do would relieve any of the pain that you caused by doing that.”</span></i></p><p><span>Thaler slumped back in her chair, her head on her palm, staring at the floor throughout Quam’s reading. She appeared to give the jury and judge the middle finger as she was led out of the courthouse.</span></p><p><span>On May 19, 2022, Orono police contacted Thaler after receiving complaints of a driver with a flat tire and a broken back windshield. Officers discovered Thaler at the traffic stop with bl∅∅d in her car and chunks of flesh on her body.</span></p><p>Thaler claimed the bl<span>∅</span><span>∅</span>d was from a tampon and the flesh was from a deer she had purchased from a butcher. After driving Thaler home for 30 minutes, the police arrived, and it wasn’t until then that Eli’s body and the shotg<span>μ</span>n believed to have been used in his murdeɼ were found in the car’s trunk.</p><p>Just ten days before the boy’s pἀssing, Thaler had acquired complete custody of him. Eli’s father, Tony Hart, had often complained to the courts about Thaler’s history of dr*g usage and mental health issues, but they had never been taken seriously.</p><p>Tony Hart has brought a wrongful deἀth claim against the Dakota County staff members who granted Thaler custody.<a href=# rel=noopener> According to CBSNews</a>, a federal court will consider the case in 2024.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/julissa-thaler-1.webp alt="julissa thaler " width=1200 height=628 title="Who is Julissa Thaler.....The Woman Who Murdeɼed Her 6-Year-Old Son?" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><strong>San Francisco Computer Executive’s Stἀbbing Deἀth: Suspect in Custody.</strong>&nbsp;Unveiling the Prime Suspect in Bob Lee’s Murdeɼ&nbsp;Case: Nima Momeni!
