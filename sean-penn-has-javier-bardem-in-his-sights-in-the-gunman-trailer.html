Penned by Pete Travis (Dredd) and based on the novel by Jean-Patrick Manchette, The Gunman follows Penn’s Jim Terrier, an international assassin who longs to put his murderous days behind him. When his former organization vows to silence him on their exploits, they kidnap his girlfriend (Jasmine Trinca), prompting Terrier to embark on a dangerous mission to retrieve her.</p><p data-characters=406 data-current-count=406 data-injectable=true>As you might anticipate, his ordeal spans the globe in a generous nod to Taken. On hand are a number of action archetypes who pop up in the shape of Javier Bardem as the obligatory villain, Idris Elba as a buddy and Ray Winstone in the wise mentor role. Capitalizing on the worldwide success of the Neeson franchise, it offers a new perspective on Penn, who at long last is taking to the action hero genre.</p><p data-characters=146 data-current-count=146 data-injectable=false>Will it prove to be a solid actioner in its own right, or a mere retread? We’ll find out when <strong>The Gunman</strong> opens in theatres March 20th, 2015.</p><p>In THE GUNMAN, Sean Penn stars as a former special forces soldier and military contractor suffering from PTSD. He tries to reconnect with his long time love, but first must go on the run from London to Barcelona and across Europe in order to clear his name.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJoqp6ZnmK9prrNZqGarpmav26uwKubnqVdqLaotNOsZK2glWK0trrMmqVmrKKWtq2x0Wg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ghostbusters-3-set-photos-reveal-the-return-of-the-ecto-1.html><span>←</span><span>Ghostbusters 3 Set Photos Reveal The Return Of The Ecto-1</span></a>
