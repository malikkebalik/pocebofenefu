Lasseter runs Skydance Animation, and he previously served as the chief creative officer at <a href=# title="Walt Disney Net Worth">Walt Disney</a> Animation Studios, Pixar Animation Studios, and Disneytoon Studios. He was also Walt Disney Imagineering's Principal Creative Advisor.

Lasseter took a leave of absence from Disney in November 2017 after he was accused of sexual misconduct toward employees. In June 2018, Disney announced that John would "assume a consulting role at The Walt Disney Company until December 31, 2018, at which time he will be leaving the company." In January 2019, he was hired by Skydance Animation, becoming the head of the company.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>John Lasseter was born John Alan Lasseter on January 12, 1957, in Hollywood, California. His father, Paul, worked as a parts manager at a car dealership, and his mother, Jewell, was a high school art teacher. John and his fraternal twin, Johanna, grew up in Whittier, California, and he became interested in animation at a young age, thanks to his mother's profession. After reading the Bob Thomas book "The Art of Animation," Lasseter realized that he wanted a career in animation. In 1975, he enrolled at the California Institute of the Arts and was only the second student to sign up for the school's new Character Animation program, which was created by two Disney animators, T. Hee and Jack Hannah. The program was taught by veteran Disney animators Eric Larson, Ollie Johnston, and <a href=# title="Frank Thomas Net Worth">Frank Thomas</a>. During his time in the CalArts Character Animation program, John produced the shorts "Lady and the Lamp" (1979) and "Nitemare" (1980), which both won Student Academy Awards for Animation. During summer breaks, Lasseter worked at the Walt Disney Company and took a job as a skipper on the Jungle Cruise.</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>After Lasseter graduated from CalArts, he was hired as an animator at Walt Disney Productions. In the early '80s, he saw some videos from computer-graphics conferences that got him excited about the future of computer animation, and he later worked on a computer animated short test film of "Where the Wild Things Are" with <a href=# title="Glen Keane Net Worth">Glen Keane</a>. Their direct superiors weren't happy about this and canceled the project, then told Lasseter, "Well, John, your project is now complete, so your employment with the Disney Studios is now terminated." He later worked freelance for Lucasfilm Computer Graphics Group's Ed Catmull on the company's first computer animated short, "The Adventures of André & Wally B." In October 1984, Lasseter became a full-time employee at Lucasfilm, and he later worked on the special effects for "Young Sherlock Holmes" with Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), creating the first-ever "fully computer-generated photorealistic animated character." Lasseter and Catmull went on to make the first computer-animated feature film, 1995's "Toy Story." After <a href=# title="George Lucas Net Worth">George Lucas</a>' divorce, he sold Lucasfilm Computer Graphics, which was known as Pixar Graphics Group by that time. Pixar became a separate corporation in 1986, and Apple co-founder <a href=# title="Steve Jobs Net Worth">Steve Jobs</a> was the majority shareholder. While he was with the company, Lasseter oversaw every Pixar film as an executive producer.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-167500 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/GettyImages-473873842.jpg alt="John Lasseter" width=594 height=395 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-167500 class=wp-caption-text>Pascal Le Segretain / Getty Images</p><p>Disney purchased Pixar in 2006 and named John the chief creative officer of Walt Disney Feature Animation (which he later renamed Walt Disney Animation Studios) and Pixar.
