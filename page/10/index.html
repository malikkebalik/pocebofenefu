One common complaint about Star Wars on Disney Plus is that we not only get short six-episode seasons, but that each individual chapter is too short. Annoyed fans have a point; strip out the recap, opening titles, and credits, and you can be left with just half an hour of new content each week. If a whole season of TV is going to clock in at around three hours, you’d be forgiven for wondering why this story couldn’t have been a movie.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>YouTuber Jake Koehler Wiki, Age, Girlfriend, Height, Net Worth &amp;amp; More</h2><time>Sep 16, 2024</time>

Twilight and the three books that followed in its series are notoriously not sensual. Written by Stephenie Meyer, they leave a lot to be desired when it comes to the desirable, and that might have something to do with Meyer’s religion. And it’s also marketed toward teens and tweens.&nbsp;
Regardless, the movies are a little steamier, if only because you can actually see Edward Cullen and Bella Swan make out or see him grab her on a bed or something along those lines.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>How Many Kids Do 'Dream Home Makeover' Hosts Shea and Syd McGee Have?</h2><time>Sep 15, 2024</time>
