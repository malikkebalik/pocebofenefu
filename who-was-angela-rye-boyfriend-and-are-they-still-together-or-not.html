The native of Chicago revealed:</p><p>“There is definitely a connection with Angela Rye. She’s a lovely woman, I’m dating her, I’m happy right now and she’s an incredible human being.”</p><p>When the Emmy, Grammy and Oscar winner and Rye were spotted on the red carpet at the 2017 Creative Arts Emmys together, rumors that they were dating began to circulate. After the star’s victory, Rye posted a tribute to him on her <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram Official account</a> which only fanned the speculations more.</p><p>According to the Facebook post, Common talks about dating Angela Rye and in the post provided below you know more about their relationship.</p><p><strong>If you’re interested in reading more about the love lives of other celebrities, check out the posts which we have given below:</strong></p><h2><strong>Are Angela Rye and Common Still Together or Not?</strong></h2><p>From the outside looking in, Angela Rye and Common seemed like the ideal pair, but it wasn’t meant to be. The Chicago rapper said in August that he had sought therapy to repair himself before attempting to reconcile with Rye. <strong>Nevertheless, by October 2019, the couple had broken up for good</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Angela-Rye-and-Common.jpg><p>There were following rumors that Common was dating Tiffany Haddish, although this has not been substantiated. Angela may be moving on from her ex-boyfriend, but not before explaining why. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The political analyst claims</a> that she and Common split up because they had different priorities in life on her self-titled podcast.</p><p>Common didn’t want kids, whereas Rye did. After disclosing her September breakup with Common, she said:</p><p>“We just want different things, I had told him about it the day before. As I’m leaning toward I want kids and he’s leaning toward “I don’t know” we’ve been discussing the possibility of starting a family for the past two months. When someone says “I don’t know” I suppose it’s because they don’t want to hurt you”.</p><p>Rye continued:</p><p>“I think it was an impeccable parting of ways. We’re very clear about the fact that we were not aligned in those interests. We will always be friends. He’s a really good person.”</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Follow us on Twitter</a> to keep up with the newest celebrity news, including marriage, divorce, breakups and more.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiulaPBtr7Eo6alrF6YvK57kWlpbGdgaXxyfI6apaCdnJZ6s8XEZpuarJmjtHA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bankrupt-rhonj-s-teresa-giudice-show-edited-to-make-it-look-like-i-was-spending.html><span>←</span><span>Bankrupt RHONJs Teresa Giudice: show edited to make it look like I was spending</span></a>
