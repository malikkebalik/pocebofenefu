<span>Martina Birk</span></p><h1>The 15 Most Incredible &amp;quot;As Seen On TV&amp;quot; Hair Tools You Can Buy PHOTOS</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>In the entire history of my life I've only owned one <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>As Seen On TV hair tool</a>. It had to be cut out of my best friend's hair at a sleepover when we were 10. So, naturally, I'm a little wary of buying hair products from infomercials. My mom, however, has an addiction to QVC and all the <a href=# class=T3D>weird As Seen On TV products</a>, especially when it comes to products that fix a very niche need she previously didn't even know she had.</p><p>I've never really understood her need to buy useless items that end up being used once as a gimmick then hidden in a cupboard until the end of time, but nonetheless I encouraged her. Mainly because the one time we did try one of these products out, it was usually hilarious. Thankfully, she tended to opt for the food related options, so nobody had to have hair braiding equipment forcibly removed from their head ever again.</p><p>What As Seen On TV products have always specialized in is creating problems you never thought of, only to then solve them with their product. It's peak capitalism and excellent marketing — don't even pretend like you could resist a good <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Snuggie</a> — and these products are just some prime examples of selling you something you suddenly need desperately.</p><h3>1. <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Rollers That Aren't Rollers</a></h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p><b><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Click N Curl</a>, $40, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>As Seen On TV</a></b></p><p>Instead of using rollers in the usual way, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Click N Curl </a>has attached a removable handle to your rollers, so you can brush you hair, roll it up, heat it and then simply press a button and release the handle. Only to repeat the process by attaching a new roller onto the handle. I'm sure this would actually make using rollers mildly easier.</p><h3>2. <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>A Hairbrush</a></h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p><b><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>The Wet Brush</a>, $14, </b><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><b>As Seen On TV</b></a></p><p>While I was pretty sceptical over how <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>this brush</a> would work better than any other brush, there are plenty of <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>positive reviews online</a>. One blogger commented, "Brushing through snarls and knots is almost completely pain-free and only requires a pass of the brush or two."</p><p>Well then. Seems like a good investment.</p><h3>3. <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Sleepover Torture Device</a></h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p><b><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Glam Twirl</a>, $11, </b><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><b>As Seen On TV</b></a></p><p>If you can think back to a couple of paragraphs ago, where I explained about <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>a hair braiding device</a> that ripped out my BFF's hair in a cruel twist of fate, this is essentially the same product. If you want to braid your hair, I'd highly advise you just do it old school with your actual human hands, instead of mistakenly trusting a tiny purple machine to do it for you.</p><h3>4. <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Colored Hair Spray For Grown Ups</a></h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p><b><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Gray Away Root Concealer</a>, $9, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Target</a></b>Spraying my hair hot pink for school discos when I was in elementary school was my favorite part of dressing up for most of my childhood. Now, As Seen On TV has extended the experience to adulthood, because if you CBA dyeing your roots on time, you can cover them with <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>this temporary spray</a> on color for more effort and less permanence.</p><h3>5. <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>A Lot Of Hot Air</a></h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p><b><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Air Curler</a>, $8, </b><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><b>As Seen On TV</b></a></p><p><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>This product</a> promises to spin "your hair like a tornado to dry and curl your hair in seconds." This product not only looks ridiculous, but YouTube videos seem to indicate it's <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>not really worth the time or effort</a>. Vlogger Natasha Elisa commented, "I have one curl! In the time it would take me to do half my head with a curling iron, but hey! It was exciting."</p><p>I guess that's why nobody's ever made it out of a tornado stunning head of curls.</p><h3>6. <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>A New Kind Of Clip</a></h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p><b><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Twist N Clip</a>, $7, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Amazon</a></b></p><p>I don't know about you, but my mom owns every alternative to a hair bobble that she possibly can. The market is huge for this kind of thing and As Seen On TV is only cashing in on said market.</p><h3>7. <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>A Large Piece Of Plastic</a></h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p><b><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Hair Washing Tray</a>, $21, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Amazon</a></b></p><p>The only person I can imagine purchasing <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>this</a> is a hairdresser, and surely they'd buy it from an actual hairdressing supply shop?</p><h3>8. <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Another Hairbrush</a></h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p><b><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>ExStatic Hairbrush</a>, $15, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Amazon</a></b></p><p><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>This hairbrush</a> isn't promising detangling, but promising sleeker hair and a lack of static. Awesome for if you're just sitting around the house completely still, but I doubt the effects would last in the real world.</p><h3>9. <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>A Pointless Stand</a></h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p><b><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Hair Dryer Stand</a>, $25, </b><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><b>As Seen On TV</b></a></p><p>"Now you can eliminate the fatigue of holding that heavy hair dryer!" Comments the As Seen On TV website, going in for the hard sell, as if nobody has ever held a hair dryer and knows they aren't that heavy. Not heavy enough to require two stands, anyway.</p><h3>10. <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Spray On Hair</a></h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p><b><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>My Secret Hair Enhancer</a>, $15, </b><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><b>As Seen On TV</b></a></p><p>THIS IS THE FUTURE.</p><h3>11. <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>An Actually Useful Hairbrush</a></h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p><b><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Simply Straight Ceramic Straightening Brush</a>, $40, </b><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><b>As Seen On TV</b></a></p><p>This is the first product in the list where I actually would be tempted to purchase it, if it worked. Luckily, reviews seem to point towards this brush being a great buy, especially for <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>natural hair</a>.</p><h3>12. <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Demi Lovato's Secret</a></h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p><b><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Secret Color Hair Extensions</a>, $4, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Amazon</a></b></p><p>If something is celebrity endorsed, it usually means it's a better quality than most other products. <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>These easy to use extensions</a> have great reviews so they're probably worth investing in.</p><h3>13. <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Robocop's Hairdressing Cousin</a></h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p><b><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Robocut</a>, $35, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Amazon</a></b></p><p>Robocut is a vacuum that cuts your hair, as if that's something that we have always been missing in our lives. If it wasn't for the awesome product name of "Robocut" I'd be bashing anybody who'd willingly spend over $70 on a vacuum hair cutting device instead of going to a salon. But with that name, I kind of want to buy everyone I know a Robocut for Christmas.</p><h3>14. <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Another Hair Straightening Brush</a></h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p><b><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Straight N Go Hair Straightening Brush</a>, $15, </b><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><b>As Seen On TV</b></a></p><p>Why have one straightening hair brush when you can have two? And <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>this one</a> comes in hot pink, which is a main selling point to me TBH.</p><h3>15. <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Glitter Hair Stamps</a></h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p><b><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Hot Stamps</a>, $7, </b><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><b>As Seen On TV</b></a></p><p>Ending my list with the best hair product I've seen in the last five years — glitter hair stamps. I wish I'd had these as a kid and I'm definitely investing in some as an adult, because this is obviously the best product As Seen On TV have ever produced.</p><p>Who knows, maybe these products will be everywhere in a couple of years and I'll be ridiculed for the ignorance I've shown here. More likely though, at least a few of these products will be banned from public use. Either way, please contact me if you decide to buy the hair cutting vacuum, because I really want to see how that turns out for you.</p><p><i>Images: Courtesy Brand</i></p><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunCt0a2gnKSVqHxygpNpZ2llpJ2ybn2UZqSoq6Ritq%2Bv0Z6bopqcmnqiv4ysnJ6mXaS7bsDVZp%2BaoaJiwbC7y6xksqelYrCiuoybrLJloJ28tbvS</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./love-island-tink-reading-ethnicity-where-is-she-from.html><span>←</span><span>Love Island Tink Reading Ethnicity: Where is She From?</span></a>
