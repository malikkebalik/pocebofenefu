She spread ricotta cheese over each noodle, sprinkled on salt and pepper, and added a layer of apricot preserves. “Bear with me here. This is not a sweet pasta dish but I’m going to add some prosciutto in a second and it’s nice to have that little salty-sweet thing going on,” she explained.</p><p id=par-6_49>The Food Network host topped each noodle with prosciutto, basil leaves, and mozzarella cheese. “You just want to keep in mind this is going to be rolled up and sliced so if you stuff it too full, it’s going to be really hard to keep it together,” she shared.</p><p id=par-7_49>Drummond rolled each lasagna noodle up, tucking the toppings in as she went. Then she cut the roll into thirds with a serrated knife and placed the pieces into a baking dish. She combined heavy cream, garlic, pecorino romano cheese, salt, and pepper and poured it over the pasta.</p><p id=par-8_31>“Honestly, this is a relatively simple dish. Just takes a little assembly time but the payoff, in terms of how much time it takes it to prepare, it’s great,” she said.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Drummond baked the lasagna dish and added finishing touches before serving</h2><p id=par-9_22>The Pioneer Woman star sprinkled mozzarella on top and baked it in a 375 degree Fahrenheit oven for 14 to 16 minutes.</p><p id=par-10_49>The Food Network host <a href=#>drizzled balsamic glaze</a> over the top and garnished the lasagna roll-ups with basil leaves. “I have a new motto,” she said. “We don’t get to make anything that we don’t eat and taste. We don’t get to make anything and just look at it anymore.”</p><p id=par-11_6>Drummond added, “Those days are over.”</p><p id=par-12_31>She shared a bite with her nephew Stu, who was impressed with the pasta dish. “This is certifiably some of the best food that I’ve ever had,” he told his aunt.</p><p id=par-13_8>Drummond added, “And that is saying a lot.”</p><p id=par-14_10>The full recipe is available on the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Food Network</a> website.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTBqbGMqaCoppWav27DzqaYp2WimrJusNGupKannpl6ra3Smp6nmV2nvK24jK6nrGWimrCqvMRmqq2qkaO0pnnIp56rnZSesq%2FAjaGrpqRf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./he-looks-like-michael-keaton-age-filter-turns-husband-into-old-man-batman-but-he-s-still-g.html><span>←</span><span>He looks like Michael Keaton: Age filter turns husband into Old Man Batman, but hes still g</span></a>
