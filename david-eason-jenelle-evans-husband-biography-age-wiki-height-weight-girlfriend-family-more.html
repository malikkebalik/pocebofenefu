The incident happened earlier on 13 October 2018.</p><p>She later admitted they were both intoxicated and their conversation about David’s attempt to avoid a televised pumpkin patch visit with his children escalated to conflict. The incident came when Jenelle recovered from septum surgery on her nose. He also made a homophobic tweet in February 2018 on his Twitter.</p><p>He attracted much public criticism. He deleted his Tweets and had his Twitter account deactivated. MTV fired him from the Teen Mom 2 reality show after he got huge criticism.

The couple has three children, a daughter called Maryssa Rose and Ensley Jolie and a son called Kaden David. In 2019, the pair legally split ways.
