Here's how the home was described in its official marketing materials, which decided to leave out the Weezy connection:</p><p><strong>"Quality, design, and execution. This new Contemporary home is a result of meticulous planning and precise execution. Perfectly located on the best location within Gated Allison Island. Direct Sunsets, tranquil waters, and vast water-frontage, 110′, offer the best panoramic views the island has to offer. Home features a tall custom crafted Mahogany entry, uniquely lacquered fireplace, 22′ ceilings in the great room.</strong></p><p><strong>"Bright and open kitchen, custom Italian cabinetry Subzero and Wolf appliances adjacent to exposed courtyard with two 20ft living walls. Butlers kitchen and staff quarters with dedicated entrance. Individual cellars for wine purists."</strong></p><p>The sale means Wayne is exiting Miami after a long residence in the city, having moved into a $15.4 million home in the Hidden Hills community in Los Angeles. The rapper has not commented on the deal publicly, so it's not known whether he intends to return any time soon.</p><p>As for Lil Wayne's former Miami dream mansion, you can take a look at it in the video below from S&S Global Relocation on YouTube:</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcK%2FEpZybqpmpxm60zqacrGecnrluw8CypZ5lo5q5rb%2BMpqCapZliuqK60qKmp2WWpL9ufpdmpKKknJ68r3s%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kate-maloney-new-boyfriend-satchel-clendenin-age-gap-and-net-worth-revealed.html><span>←</span><span>Kate Maloney New Boyfriend Satchel Clendenin Age Gap And Net Worth Revealed</span></a>
