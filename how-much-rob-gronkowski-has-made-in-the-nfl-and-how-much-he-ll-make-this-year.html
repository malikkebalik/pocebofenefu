That means the Bucs will owe him $10 million this season. By comparison, Brate is due $4.25 million and Howard will make $1.97 million in 2020.</span></p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-298466 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/GettyImages-518070940.jpg alt width=900 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-298466 class=wp-caption-text>Jonathan Leibson/Getty Images for Bethesda Softworks</p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Gronkowski sat out the 2019 season, but he's already working back towards playing shape. For his regular-season career, he's recorded 521 receptions, 7,861 yards, and 79 touchdowns (and an additional rushing touchdown, for good measure). He's also said he hasn't spent a dime from his career earnings; all of his purchases have come from endorsement money.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>In nine seasons, Gronkowski made $54 million. The tight end stressed simplicity with finances. He lives by a simple mantra: get what you need to be comfortable, and then save everything else. It's a similar mindset that billionaires have, and for a guy who has taken both party buses and cruises around the world, it's a remarkably steady outlook.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Assuming the NFL season moves forward as planned, Gronk will add a nice chunk of change to his already sizable nest egg. And he'll once again be reunited with the only quarterback he's ever known.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcL%2FPqKmtq12jsri%2FjqGmsGWdqrCpedGomWafoqS7rLvWrKKiZZiWwG65wJ2cZqGeYsGpsYynnaVlkaOxbrTOsGSmrZOdeqmxy6Vkppmbmnq1tMisZLKdkad8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./everything-she-s-said-about-love-and-her-5-year-window-to-find-the-one.html><span>←</span><span>Everything She's Said About Love and Her 5-Year Window to Find the 'One'</span></a>
