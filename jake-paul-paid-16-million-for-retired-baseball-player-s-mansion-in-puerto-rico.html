There's the 7,632-square-foot main house with eight beds, eight baths, and two half-baths, plus a 5,000-square-foot "entertainment building," per the property's official listing on the Caribbean Realty website.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-347946 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/caribbean-realty-group4.jpg alt width=900 height=599 sizes="(max-width: 1074px) 100vw, 1074px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-347946 class=wp-caption-text>Via Caribbean Realty</p><p>The listing goes on:</p><p><strong>"Built-in 2021 with high-end finishes and true quality craftsmanship can be throughout the home, this space is truly move-in ready. Hand-selected tile flooring, natural light, and elegant fixtures fill the open-concept entertaining spaces and private rooms, creating an elevated living experience. Your inner home chef will delight in taking advantage of the expansive kitchen designed with solid wood-style cabinets, spacious countertops, and a beautiful backsplash with views of the patio just beyond the kitchen from the sliding glass doors. The Legacy additionally offers a private bar area within the home with a custom-crafted Samsung TV -the first of its kind on all of the island."</strong></p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-347947 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/caribbean-realty-group3.jpg alt width=900 height=675 sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-347947 class=wp-caption-text>Via Caribbean Realty</p><p>The listing also touts the home's luxurious swimming pool and outdoor patio, as well as touches like a secluded office specifically engineered as a work-from-home space for Zoom calls and other situations where quiet is called for. It's also got a wet bar, a dry bar, an elevator, and a garage with room for six cars.</p><p>The surrounding neighborhood of Dorado Beach is a gem, too, with "golfing at the Dorado Beach East Golf Course, shopping, or dining at some favorite local restaurants with traditional food."</p><p>Molina just recently retired from his baseball career, while Jake and his brother <a href=#>Logan Paul</a> moved to Puerto Rico years ago in order to train there for fights. But Molina's future plans, real estate-wise, aren't known as yet.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcK%2FEpZybqpmpxm60zqacrGealrimec%2BarKVlkqrGtHnPrpyrrJ9iv6qvzmakmqajnryvew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./english-translation-of-the-circle-of-life-intro-from-the-lion-king.html><span>←</span><span>English Translation of the 'Circle of Life' Intro From 'the Lion King'</span></a>
