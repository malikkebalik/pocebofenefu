Here’s a breakdown of the two tragic episodes.</p><h2 id=h-how-andrew-deluca-died-in-grey-s-anatomy-season-17-episode-7><strong>How Andrew DeLuca died in ‘Grey’s Anatomy’ Season 17 Episode 7</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-1><p></p></figure><p id=par-2_44>In Station 19 Season 4 Episode 6, titled “Train in Vain,” DeLuca tracked down sex trafficker Opal (Stephanie Kurtzuba). Then at the end of the episode, a man bumped into DeLuca, knocking him to the ground. But viewers didn’t realize what happened until later.</p><p id=par-3_39>Carina (Stefania Spampinato) found DeLuca on the floor, covering a stab wound. DeLuca was taken to Grey Sloan Memorial in an ambulance.

Time of death — 22:50. That said, DeLuca was given a proper goodbye on <a href=#>Meredith Grey’s (Ellen Pompeo) dream beach</a>.

The actor revealed showrunner Krista Vernoff and executive producer Debbie Allen initially told him about killing off DeLuca. And ultimately, Gianniotti was more than happy to tell his character’s “beautiful story.” He said:</p><p>It was a really beautiful story and an opportunity to highlight a huge issue of human trafficking and its horrible, horrible impact on the world and the U.S., and there was an opportunity to have DeLuca die a hero and to have justice brought to these perpetrators and horrible people who had been hurting these young girls.</p><p id=par-7_15>The former Grey’s Anatomy star also noted that he was ready to leave the show.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-8_30>“I’ve been on the show for a long time — seven seasons — and I think this is a good time to exit and have a fresh start,” Gianniotti said.</p><h2 id=h-giacomo-giannotti-on-returning-as-andrew-deluca-on-grey-s-anatomy><strong>Giacomo Giannotti on returning as Andrew DeLuca on ‘Grey’s Anatomy’</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-9_58>While DeLuca was killed off in Grey’s Anatomy Season 17 Episode 7, fans saw the character again a few episodes later in Teddy’s dream state.
