Wheaton subsequently clarified his opinion after receiving criticism.</p><p>Nintendo of America announced on Twitter that Wheaton would be voicing Abraham Lincoln in Code Name: STEAM. Wheaton announced in February 2015 that he was chosen to provide voiceover talent for the upcoming strategy role-playing video game Firefly Online, a game based on Joss Whedon's Firefly sci-fi franchise.

He subsequently campaigned for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 general election.</p><p>Later, I determined that the people who were really, really cruel – like the Usenet weenies – really are a statistically insignificant number of people. And I know, just over the years from people who've e-mailed me at my website and people who I've talked to since I started going to Star Trek conventions again in the last five years, that there are so many more people who really enjoyed everything about the show, including my performance, including the character.</p><p>Wheaton has also narrated a number of bestselling audiobooks, mostly in the science-fiction and fantasy category, including Ready Player One by <a href=#>Ernest Cline</a> (Wheaton also exists in the novel's universe, described as being joint President, along with <a href=#>Cory Doctorow</a>, of the virtual world Oasis, which is the setting for much of the book), "Armada" also by Cline, Redshirts by <a href=#>John Scalzi</a>, "Fuzzy Nation" also by Scalzi, and books 6–10 of the Chronicles of Amber series by <a href=#>Roger Zelazny</a>.</p><p>From September 2006 to September 2007, Wheaton hosted a Revision3 syndicated video podcast called InDigital along with <a href=#>Jessica Corbin</a> and Hahn Choi.

On April 3, 2014, Wheaton announced on his blog that his new show called The Wil Wheaton Project would premiere on the SyFy network at 10pm on May 27 for an initial projected run of twelve episodes. However, on August 29, Wheaton blogged that SyFy canceled the show after only one season.</p><p>A fictionalized version of Wheaton was included in the comic book PS 238, in which he harbors the power of telekinesis. Wheaton's debut comic book The Guild: Fawkes, which he wrote alongside <a href=#>Felicia Day</a>, was released on May 23, 2012.</p><p>Wheaton is a Dungeons & Dragons player, and played during the PAX 2010 event using the 4th edition rules. Wheaton, along with webcartoonists <a href=#>Jerry Holkins</a> and <a href=#>Mike Krahulik</a> of <a href=#>Penny Arcade</a>, and <a href=#>Scott Kurtz</a> of PvP, played in front of a live audience.

Wheaton also played D&D 4th edition at the PAX 2011 event using the 4th edition rules, and used the D&D Next play test rules at PAX Prime 2012.</p><p>He appeared as a fictionalized version of himself in several episodes of the sitcom The Big Bang Theory, starting in season 3, episode 4: "The Creepy Candy Coating Corollary" (2009). On the show, Wheaton behaves in comically petty and manipulative ways towards main character <a href=#>Sheldon Cooper</a>, who regards him as an archenemy until the season 5 episode "The Russian Rocket Reaction", when they make amends and become friends. Wheaton appears in 12 episodes in a recurring, guest-starring role on Eureka, playing Dr. Isaac Parrish, the head of the Non-Lethal Weapons Lab at Global Dynamics and a thorn in Fargo's side. Wheaton also voices the character of the former scoutmaster and current sous-chef Earl Harlan in the popular dark, surreal-comedy podcast Welcome to Night Vale.</p><p>With the release of Sunken Treasure: Wil Wheaton's Hot Cocoa Box Sampler in February 2009, instead of using traditional publishing, Wheaton decided to self-publish using Lulu Publishing, releasing paperback and digital copies, something he has continued to do with all his publications since. As a chapbook, Sunken Treasure contains several small extracts of various different projects, including two short stories from Ficlets, an ACME comedy sketch, William's Tell and a Criminal Minds production diary. The production diary was later released as an audiobook. Later that same year, Wheaton released Memories of the Future: Volume 1, a humorous critique, as well as an account of Wheaton's own experiences with, and memories of, the first thirteen episodes of Star Trek: The Next Generation. Closing up 2009, Wheaton published a special edition of The Happiest Days of Our Lives, which also included an afterword by his son, Ryan. The Happiest Days of Our Lives and Sunken Treasure were also released on a Creative Commons license.</p><p>Wheaton has worked as a voice actor in animation, video games and audiobooks, beginning with the role of Martin Brisby in The Secret of NIMH at age 10. His most noteworthy credits include the roles of Aqualad in the cartoons Teen Titans and Teen Titans Go!, the voice of radio journalist <a href=#>Richard Burns</a> in Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, Kyle in the Nickelodeon cartoon, Kyle + Rosemary as well as himself and various other characters on both Family Guy and Seth MacFarlane's Cavalcade of Cartoon Comedy. Wheaton also featured as the second Blue Beetle, Ted Kord, on Batman: The Brave and the Bold, Dr. Peter Meechum in Generator Rex, Mike Morningstar / Darkstar in Ben 10: Alien Force, Ben 10: Ultimate Alien & Ben 10: Omniverse. Wheaton also took upon the anime roles of Yakumo in Kurokami: The Animation, Menma in Naruto, Hans in Slayers Evolution-R, Aaron Terzieff in Mobile Suit Gundam Unicorn. He also appeared as himself in a skit on nerdcore rapper MC Frontalot's 2008 album Final Boss attempting to be a rapper, whose rhymes only involved shellfish. Wheaton later collaborated with Frontalot on "Your Friend Wil", a track from the 2010 album Zero Day on the subject of what Wheaton calls "Wheaton's law": "don't be a dick". Wheaton and Frontalot have both appeared at the <a href=#>Penny Arcade</a> Expo (PAX).</p><p>He supported Barack Obama in the 2008 United States presidential election, and opposed Proposition 8, calling it "nothing but hate and discrimination".</p><p>Wheaton was a contestant on a 2001 episode of The Weakest Link featuring Star Trek actors attempting to win money for charity. He has made guest appearances on the November 23, 2007, episode of the TV series Numb3rs, and the October 22, 2008, episode of the series Criminal Minds, and appeared in Internet presentations, including a cameo in a comedy sketch ("Lock Out") for LoadingReadyRun (and a reprise of the same the following year, in CommodoreHustle 4), and the May 30, 2008, episode of the Internet series Gorgeous Tiny Chicken Machine Show. From 2009-2011, Wheaton appeared in seasons 3, 4, and 5 of the web series The Guild as Fawkes, the leader for a rival guild known as Axis of Anarchy. Wheaton credits his roles in Gorgeous Tiny Chicken Machine Show and The Guild for reigniting his career by encouraging him to seek out roles as the "Villain You Love To Hate" stock character. He also appears in seasons 2, 3, and 4 of the television series Leverage, as rival computer hacker Colin "Chaos" Mason, antagonist to Leverage team hacker Alec Hardison. He makes regular appearances in many web productions for Geek & Sundry, including hosting TableTop, a board game based show, and Titansgrave, a roleplaying game based show.</p><p>On August 24, 2007, Wheaton gave the keynote address for the yearly <a href=#>Penny Arcade</a> Expo, which was subsequently made available online. He stepped in following a public battle between the formerly-scheduled keynote debate participants, noted anti-games activist Jack Thompson and <a href=#>Hal Halpin</a>, the president of the Entertainment Consumers Association (ECA). Much of Wheaton's address focused on the debate over violence in video games. He also gave the keynote at PAX East 2010 in Boston, Massachusetts.</p><p>Wheaton's notoriety among Star Trek fandom is covered in a number of web comics. For example, ArcaneTimes (March 25, 2005) offers a sympathetic position; Something Positive presents a range of opinions on the storyline Mike's Kid; and Abstruse Goose tries to distinguish between the character and the actor.</p><p>In 2003, Wheaton mentioned his love for the game of poker on his blog. The following year, he began writing more extensively about his poker-playing experiences, including stories about playing Texas hold 'em tournaments locally and in Las Vegas. Eventually, he worked up to regular play, including a run at the 2005 World Poker Tour Championships. On June 23, 2005, Wheaton accepted an invitation to join Team PokerStars. He went on to play in that year's World Series of Poker and was the guest speaker for the 2005 BARGE Banquet. In June 2007, he announced he would no longer be on Team Pokerstars due to changes in the US legal system that would cause poker sites to have to focus on European and Asian markets and held a farewell Pokerstars tournament on June 5, 2007, which he titled So Long and Thanks for All the Chips.</p><p>Wheaton described himself as a liberal in 2005. In September 2006, he criticized George W. Bush's plan to suspend habeas corpus and to use torture: "Shame on President Bush. Shame on his Republican allies in Congress, and shame on the spineless, cowardly Democrats who did not stand up to them." In a column that he wrote for Salon.com in 2005, The Real War on Christmas, Wheaton attacked conservative commentators like Bill O'Reilly, Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity for influencing the political views of his parents, with whom Wheaton found himself unable to have political discussions during family get-togethers on holidays like Christmas. Wheaton's parents were very offended by the article, and he posted a lengthy apology on his site and an interview in which his parents clarified their political views.</p><p>In early 2003, he founded the independent publishing company Monolith Press and released a memoir entitled Dancing Barefoot. Monolith Press was "founded on the idea that publication should not be limited by opportunity." Most of the entries are extended versions of his blog entries. Dancing Barefoot sold out three printings in four months. In winter 2003, Wheaton signed to publisher <a href=#>Tim O'Reilly</a> with a three-book contract. O'Reilly acquired Dancing Barefoot, and published his extended memoirs, Just a Geek, in summer of 2004. He has since written about his bitterness regarding how the book was marketed, believing it was pitched as a Star Trek book when he intended it as more of a personal memoir. Subsequently, in 2007, his next book, The Happiest Days of Our Lives was again published by Monolith Press.</p><p>Wheaton is a supporter of the Electronic Frontier Foundation and has been involved with the organization since 2002.</p><p>Wheaton was roommates with Chris Hardwick at UCLA. They met at a showing of Arachnophobia in Burbank, California. Wheaton married Anne Prince on November 7, 1999, and lives in Arcadia, California, with her and her two sons from a previous relationship. When one son was 19, he asked Wheaton to legally adopt him, which he did.</p><p>Wheaton played Joey Trotta in the action film Toy Soldiers (1991). After leaving Star Trek, he moved to Topeka, Kansas, to work for NewTek, where he helped to develop the Video Toaster 4000 doing product testing and quality control and later used his public profile to serve as a technology evangelist for the product. Wheaton said this was a period of growth in his life, and living away from Los Angeles helped him deal with anger problems.</p><p>Afterward, he returned to Los Angeles, attended acting school for five years, and then re-entered the acting world. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Wheaton appeared in several independent films, including the award-winning The Good Things (2001), in which he portrays a frustrated Kansas tollbooth worker. For his performance in <a href=#>Jane White</a> Is Sick & Twisted (2002) he received the Best Actor award at the Melbourne Underground Film Festival.</p><p>He played Wesley Crusher for the first four seasons of Star Trek: The Next Generation, from 1987 to 1991. This became a recurring role later in the series. A vocal group of Trekkies disliked his Star Trek character and, by extension, Wheaton himself. Wheaton commented about his critics in a 2004 interview for WebTalk Radio:</p><p>He first gained widespread attention for playing Gordie Lachance in Stand by Me (1986), the film adaptation of Stephen King's novella The Body which was originally published in 1982's Different Seasons.</p><p>Wheaton made his acting debut in the television film A Long Way Home (1981), and his first cinema role was as Martin Brisby in the animated film The Secret of NIMH (1982), the movie adaptation of Robert C. O'Brien's book Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH (1971). He had a minor role in The Last Starfighter (1984) as Louis's friend, but it was cut.</p><p>Richard William Wheaton III (born July 29, 1972) is an American actor, blogger, and writer. He portrayed Wesley Crusher on the television series Star Trek: The Next Generation, Gordie Lachance in the film Stand by Me, Joey Trotta in Toy Soldiers and Bennett Hoenicker in Flubber. Wheaton has also appeared in recurring roles as Aqualad in Teen Titans, Cosmic Boy on the Legion of Super Heroes and Mike Morningstar/Darkstar in the Ben 10 universe. He also appeared regularly as a fictionalized version of himself on the CBS sitcom The Big Bang Theory and in the roles of Fawkes on The Guild, Colin Mason on Leverage and Dr. Isaac Parrish on Eureka. Wheaton was also the host and co-creator of the YouTube board game show TableTop.</p><p>Wheaton was born July 29, 1972, in Burbank, California, to Debra "Debbie" Nordean (née O'Connor), an actress, and Richard William Wheaton Jr., a medical specialist. He has a brother, Jeremy, and a sister, Amy. Both appeared uncredited in the Star Trek: The Next Generation episode "When the Bough Breaks". Amy also appeared alongside Wil in the 1987 film The Curse.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmsmZeaxKq3yGeaqKVfrLatedahnJqsn6M%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./shohei-ohtani-buys-mansion-in-la-ca%C3%B1ada-flintridge-from-adam-carolla-for-7-85-million.html><span>←</span><span>Shohei Ohtani Buys Mansion In La Caada Flintridge From Adam Carolla For $7.85 Million</span></a>
