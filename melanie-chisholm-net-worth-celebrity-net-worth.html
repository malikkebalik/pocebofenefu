She later went on to have a successful solo career with albums including "Northern Star," "Reason," "This Time," and "Version of Me."</p><h2 id=early-life-education><strong>Early Life and Education</strong></h2><p>Melanie Chisholm was born on January 12, 1974 in Whiston, England as the only daughter of Alan, who worked for the Otis Elevator Company, and Joan, a singer who worked as a personal assistant and secretary. When Chisholm was four, her parents separated; her mother subsequently remarried and had more children. Chisholm was raised in Widnes, and went to Brookvale Junior School in the nearby town of Runcorn. She then attended Fairfield High School back in Widnes. For her higher education, Chisholm studied musical theatre, dance, singing, and drama at the Doreen Bird College of Performing Arts in London. She ultimately dropped out of college just short of completing her course, and earned teaching qualifications in theatre dance with the Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing.</p><h2 id=spice-girls><strong>Spice Girls</strong></h2><p>In 1994, Chisholm, <a href=# title="Melanie Brown Net Worth">Melanie Brown</a>, <a href=# title="Geri Halliwell Net Worth">Geri Halliwell</a>, and <a href=# title="Victoria Beckham Net Worth">Victoria Beckham</a> all responded to an advertisement published in The Stage magazine looking to form a new girl group. The four were chosen from close to 400 women, and were soon joined by <a href=# title="Emma Bunton Net Worth">Emma Bunton</a> to form the quintet known as the Spice Girls. As a member of the group, Chisholm used the nickname Sporty Spice.</p><p>After touring record labels in both London and Los Angeles, they signed a deal with Virgin Records in 1995. The group's debut album, "Spice," was a massive global success upon its release in 1996, reaching number one on the carts in over 17 countries. Moreover, it became the best-selling album by a girl group in music history by selling 30 million copies worldwide. Its lead single, "Wannabe," hit number one in 37 countries. Subsequent singles such as "Say You'll Be There," "Mama," and "Who Do You Think You Are" performed similarly well, all reaching number one in the UK.</p><p>The Spice Girls released their second album, "Spiceworld," in 1997. Another huge commercial success, it spawned the number-one hit singles "Spice Up Your Life," "Too Much," and "Viva Forever," and went on to sell 20 million copies globally. The same year, the group starred in their own film, entitled "Spice World," which ended up grossing $100 million at the box office to become one of the year's biggest hits. In May of 1998, Halliwell left the group. The Spice Girls subsequently released the single "Goodbye," which was their third consecutive Christmas number-one song. They then put out the 2000 album "Forever," which did relatively well but failed to match the sales of their earlier albums. The Spice Girls reunited in 2007 to embark on a concert tour around the world; they reunited for another tour in 2019.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-165956 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/GettyImages-489852033.jpg alt="Melanie Chisholm Net Worth" width=395 height=594 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-165956 class=wp-caption-text>Ben A.
