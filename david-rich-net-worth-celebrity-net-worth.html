David Rich is one of the <strong>richest people in Mississippi</strong>. Born in Jackson, Mississippi, David Rich grew up in a family that was already quite successful in the packaged food business. His father, Robert Rich, Sr., founded Rich Foods after World War II. He focused on soy-based whipped topping and ice cream, and then expanded into nondairy creamer, frozen bread, cakes, and pies, as well as other nondairy desserts.</p><p>David Rich graduated from Bradley University and Science Virginia Theological Seminary. His brother, Robert Rich, Jr., took over as President of the company in 1978, and eventually became Chairman. David Rich is an ordained Anglican pastor and unlike his brother, chose not to work as part of the family business. However, when their father passed away in 2006, he inherited 44% of the company, which has since expanded into the Asian market quite successfully, and is now worth almost $3 billion.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6o8HSoqWeq6Oisq97wp6mrGeUlsOqsIyroJygXaOytXnWqKmtoF8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./180-riverside-boulevard-review-and-ratings.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>180 Riverside Boulevard: Review and Ratings</span></a>
