And what new project do the longtime friends reportedly have on the horizon?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr have grown their net worths since the end of The Beatles</h2><p id=par-2_74>After The Beatles broke up for good in 1970, McCartney became one of the most popular solo artists on two fronts — records sales and ticket sales (per <a href=#>Britannica</a>). He also paints and sometimes acts, appearing in Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales thanks to his friendship with <a href=#>Johnny Depp</a>. But he was rocked by an expensive divorce, which saw his ex-wife <a href=#>Heather Mills</a> walk away with $48.7 million in 2008.</p><p id=par-3_59>Similarly, Starr has also worked consistently since his time as a Beatle. And he was once named the world’s top-earning drummer, beating Phil Collins and Dave Grohl to take that number one spot (per <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Parade</a>). Furthermore, he narrated episodes of the popular children’s show Thomas the Tank Engine & Friends and voiced Mr. Conductor on the spinoff&nbsp;Shining Time Station.</p><p id=par-4_28>On top of it all, both McCartney and Starr still claim royalty payments from The Beatles’ music. So, which one of them has amassed a higher net worth?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-paul-mccartney-and-ringo-starr-who-has-a-higher-net-worth>Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr: who has a higher net worth?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-2></figure><p id=par-5_39><a href=#>Parade</a> reported McCartney’s estimated net worth in 2021 was a whopping $1.2 billion. Meanwhile, Starr’s 2021 net worth was approximately $350 million. So, McCartney’s ongoing touring career has helped make him the wealthiest Beatle, despite an ultra-expensive divorce.</p><p id=par-6_29>Notably, when John Lennon died in 1980, his net worth was around $200 million. And when <a href=#>George Harrison</a> died in 2001, his net worth was approximately $400 million.</p><p id=par-7_31>McCartney and Lennon’s estate reportedly earn the most from The Beatles’ royalty payments since they have the most songwriting credits. Those payments totaled $67 million in 2019 alone, according to Parade.</p><p id=par-8_33>During the years that McCartney tours, he can earn up to an additional $50 million. And even without hitting the road, he generates millions of dollars in album sales, licensing fees, and royalties.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr are reportedly teaming up on a future project</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-3><p lang=en dir=ltr>Following a five Emmy nomination haul for his Disney+ three-part docu ‘The Beatles: Get Back,’ Peter Jackson tells Deadline he is cooking up another film project with surviving Beatles members Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr <a href=#>https://t.co/xMNNjei2gR</a></p>— Deadline Hollywood (@DEADLINE) <a href=#>July 20, 2022</a></figure><p id=par-9_41>According to filmmaker <a href=#>Peter Jackson</a>, he is in talks with McCartney and Starr on a follow-up project for the successful Disney+ documentary,&nbsp;<a href=#>The Beatles:&nbsp;Get Back</a>.
