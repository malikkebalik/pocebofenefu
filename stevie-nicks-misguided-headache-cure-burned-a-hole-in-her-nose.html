Stevie Nicks wanted to deal with her headaches, but ended up putting her health at risk. A cure that she felt was ingenious was eroding her cartilage.

Though cocaine likely didn’t help with the spot, it was not the cause. Here’s how a misguided headache cure eventually left her with the permanent hole.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Stevie-Nicks-10.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-stevie-nicks-frequently-used-cocaine-in-the-1970s-and-1980s>Stevie Nicks frequently used cocaine in the 1970s and 1980s</h2><p id=par-2_42>After joining Fleetwood Mac in 1975, Nicks and her bandmates began using cocaine. While it was recreational at first, their usage ramped up significantly. Nicks says that while they feared drugs like heroin, they didn’t have a problem with cocaine at first.</p><p id=par-3_31>“I wish people had told us the same thing about cocaine,” she told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Telegraph</a>. “But in our day everybody was going, ‘It’s not addictive, it’s just recreational fun, blah blah blah.’”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-2 readability=2><p>https://twitter.com/ThatEricAlper/status/1411701424950591491</p></figure><p id=par-4_9>Eventually, Nicks’ usage of the drug moved past recreational.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-5_47>“I used to carry a gram of cocaine in my boot at all times,” she said for&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Oprah’s Master Class</a>. “And it was the first thing I thought of when I woke up in the morning and the last thing I thought of before I went to bed.”</p><p id=par-6_19>Nicks says that everyone around her used cocaine, but she believes that it was the biggest problem for her.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-stevie-nicks-has-a-hole-in-her-nasal-cartilage-but-not-from-cocaine>Stevie Nicks has a hole in her nasal cartilage, but not from cocaine</h2><p id=par-7_58>Following ten years of usage, Nicks received upsetting news from a plastic surgeon. She had been suffering from worrisome blackouts and soon learned that she had a hole high in her nasal cartilage. The doctor said that using cocaine even one more time&nbsp;<a href=#>could kill her</a>. He also revealed that the gap was not a result of the drug.</p><p id=par-8_37>Nicks used to dissolve aspirin in water and squirt the solution into her nose to ward off headaches. The problem is, aspirin is an acid. While trying to cure her headaches, she was inadvertently dissolving her cartilage.</p><p id=par-9_14>“I thought I was being the best, most hygienic nurse ever,” she told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Rolling Stone</a>.</p><p id=par-10_35>Regardless of where the hole came from, its presence made Nicks realize that it was dangerous for her to snort cocaine. She soon checked herself into rehab and has stayed away from the drug since.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-these-days-the-fleetwood-mac-artist-doesn-t-use-drugs-or-alcohol>These days, the Fleetwood Mac artist doesn’t use drugs or alcohol&nbsp;</h2><p id=par-11_33>After Nicks stopped using cocaine, she dealt with an addiction to&nbsp;<a href=#>her Klonopin prescription</a>, something that she says is&nbsp;<a href=#>her biggest regret</a>. Since then, she says she has stayed away from drugs and alcohol altogether.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-12_44>“I don’t drink.
