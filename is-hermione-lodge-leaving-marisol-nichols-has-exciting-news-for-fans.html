Marisol Nichols Has Exciting News for Fans</h1></header><section class=post-content><p id=par-1_61><a href=#>Riverdale</a> fans were gutted <a href=#>Marisol Nichols</a> and <a href=#>Skeet Ulrich</a> — who play Hermione Lodge and F.P. Jones — announced they were leaving the hit CW series ahead of the fifth season. The actors were expected to receive their final farewells in season 4. But when the cycle was cut short, viewers wondered whether the two characters would receive a proper goodbye.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-2_43>Now, it seems fans won’t have to prepare for at least one of the exits. Recently, Nichols confirmed she’s not only <a href=#>returning as Hermione</a> for Riverdale Season 5, but she’s also coming back better than ever in a recurring role. So get excited.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Marisol Nichols and Skeet Ulrich reveal Hermione Lodge and F.P. Jones will leave ‘Riverdale’ after season 4</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Marisol-Nichols-who-plays-Hermione-Lodge-on-Riverdale.jpg><p id=par-3_21>In February 2020, Riverdale showrunner Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa announced Nichols and Ulrich would be leaving after the fourth season. He told <a href=#>TVLine</a>:</p><p>Part of life in Riverdale — and part of growing up — is saying goodbye to people. I’m grateful to Skeet and Marisol for their incredible work on the show these last four years, and we all wish them well on their future endeavors. F.P. and Hermione will never be far from our hearts. And, of course, they’re always welcome back in Riverdale.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Marisol Nichols and Skeet Ulrich’s exit moves to ‘Riverdale’ Season 5</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-2></figure><p id=par-4_48>Unfortunately, <a href=#>Riverdale Season 4 was cut short</a> due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Production was shut down. Thus, Nichols and Ulrich’s final scenes were never filmed. But in an interview with <a href=#>Entertainment Weekly</a>, Aguirre-Sacasa promised fans Hermione and F.P. would finish up their arcs in <a href=#>Riverdale Season 5</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-5_44>“Yeah, I’ve talked to all the actors,” Aguirre-Sacasa said. “I called Marisol and Skeet and I said, ‘You know guys, obviously we still want to finish the stories we started in the season.’ And both of them were like, ‘Of course, let’s do it.’”</p><p id=par-6_13>The showrunner also confirmed neither character will die when The CW series returns.</p><p id=par-7_31>“Neither Hermione nor F.P., this isn’t a spoiler, but they’re not dying,” Aguirre-Sacasa said. “My hope is to have them be a part of Riverdale for as long as Riverdale continues.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Marisol Nichols says Hermione Lodge will return throughout ‘Riverdale’ Season 5</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-8_21>On June 11, Nichols revealed Hermione still has more stories to tell and she won’t be leaving in Riverdale Season 5.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-9_55>“I had a very long talk with Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa, our creator and showrunner of Riverdale,” Nichols told <a href=#>Access</a>. “I’m proud to announce that Hermoine will not only be back for season five, but she will be back stronger and better than ever. So I’m really excited about telling her story and that side of her.”</p><p id=par-10_27>Later, Nichols teased what Hermione’s arc will be when Riverdale returns. And it appears the character will stand up to Veronica’s (Camila Mendes) father, Hiram (Mark Consuelos).&nbsp;</p><p id=par-11_27>“We talked about the fact that Hermione is in a very abusive relationship,” Nichols said. “Not that she’s innocent herself. But this man obviously treated her horribly.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-4></figure><p id=par-12_55>She continued, “Now we’re going to get a chance to see her fight back, see her say no, and see her stick up for not only herself — but in my mind — every woman or girl out there that gets stuck in that kind of situation. So I’m really proud of what is coming.”</p><p id=par-13_15>Meanwhile, in her announcement on Instagram, Nichols confirmed <a href=#>Hermione will be back</a> for multiple episodes.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-14_55>“Hermoine will be showing back up in Riverdale for parts of Season 5, as a stronger, better, and more self-determined women than ever,” she wrote. “I am proud to be able to still be a part of my Riverdale family while I will also have the flexibility to follow my passion and pursue other ventures.”</p><p id=par-15_24>Then in the above interview with Access, Nichols shared she will also be taking on other projects as she continues Hermione’s story on Riverdale.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-16_32>“I have two documentaries that I’m producing on human trafficking as well as two other scripted shows,” Nichole said. “It leaves me open to do other things. So it’s kind of perfect.”</p><p id=par-17_5>Check out&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Showbiz Cheat Sheet</a>&nbsp;on Facebook!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS%2FqsLEq5uapJViwKat0qilZm1dnbKzuciopZ5lnKSxqLGMpZyarpmjtG65wKugrKecYruqr8eoo6xmmKm6rXs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./doc-says-singer-has-had-rhinoplasty-and-breast-augmentation.html><span>←</span><span>Doc Says Singer Has Had Rhinoplasty and Breast Augmentation</span></a>
