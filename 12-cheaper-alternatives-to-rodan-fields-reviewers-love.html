But the price point of these items (say, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>$155 for a single tube of Lash Boost</a>) can put a serious dent in any budget. So if you’re not able to spend a small fortune on your skin care, or if you’re avoiding the brand for other reasons, these <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>cheaper alternatives to Rodan + Fields</a> offer the same active ingredients and have hundreds of fans — but cost a fraction of the price.</p><p>To save you some of the work, I've read the product descriptions and ingredients lists carefully to find alternatives that offer the same benefits and feature many of the same star ingredients from powerful retinol to moisturizing ceramides. Plus, I made sure real-life customers have been happy with the texture and results of these products.</p><p>Scroll on for fan-approved alternatives to everything from Rodan + Fields’ Lash Boost to the brand’s Unblemish acne system. Not a single one is more than $35. Another plus? These can all be ordered on Amazon and delivered straight to your door.</p><h2><strong>1.</strong> The <strong>Best Lash Boost Alternative</strong></h2><p>While Rodan + Fields' Lash Boost touts fuller- and longer-looking lashes, the $155 price point certainly raises some eyebrows. But fear not, the <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Hairgenics Pronexa FantastiLash </a>costs less than $30 and, like the R + F product, boasts peptides and plenty of conditioners. With a wand applicator rather than Lash Boost's brush, it also pulls double duty on the brows. Plus, it is hypoallergenic, derm-tested, and cruelty-free.</p><p><strong>According to a fan: </strong>“I could tell my eyelashes are thicker, longer and more noticeable. My lashes dont fall out as much and appear to be healthier than they were before, I would highly recommend this product and will keep purchasing it in the future!”</p><h2><strong>2. The Budget Radiant Defense Perfecting Liquid Alternative</strong></h2><p>Rodan + Fields's Radiant Defense Perfecting Liquid is a tinted moisturizer with SPF 30, but so does <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Maybelline’s Dream Fresh BB Cream</a> — and it costs less than $10 to boot. Like the R + F product, Maybelline's BB cream promises to help smooth skin and reduce redness while also offering light coverage. This product offers a dewy finish and the sheer formula promises to be flexible enough to work for those with light to deep skin tones. For those with oily skin, there's a<a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D> salicylic acid BB cream</a> option as well.</p><p><strong>According to a fan:</strong> “I purchased Maybelline's BB cream in the shade light/medium, and it works great. It is very lightweight, so it doesn't feel like you're wearing sunscreen, and it has a pretty good amount of coverage. It did a great job of covering redness on my cheeks and a couple of fading acne scars. Overall, I think it would be a good substitute for foundation if you're going for a sheer " no makeup" look.”</p><h2>3. The <strong>Radiant Defense Perfecting Liquid Alternative With Mineral Sunscreen</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Honest Beauty’s Clean Corrective tinted moisturizer</a> boasts skin-loving ingredients like vitamin C and allantoin as well as a mineral-based SPF 30 for protection. The nine sheer shades range from fair to deep to cover an impressive range of shades. The formula is designed to reduce redness and create a smooth canvas.</p><p><strong>According to a fan: </strong>“This product goes on smooth. It is thicker than expected but has not flaked or felt heavy or clumpy. My skin is dry and it has been a great product. The color is what I expected and works well with my skin tone.”</p><h2><strong>4. The Best Rodan + Fields Unblemish Acne System Alternative</strong></h2><p>If you’re looking for a comprehensive skin-care system, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>La Roche-Posay’s Effaclar acne three-step system </a>stacks up quite nicely against the four-piece Rodan + Fields' Unblemish set. Both work to remove excess oil and impurities with the goal of reducing acne and preventing future breakouts. Both sets combine tried-and-true ingredients salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide. However, La Roche-Posay offers bigger doses. The Rodan + Fields acne wash only contains 0.5% salicylic acid, while the cheaper option offers 2%; and when it comes to the benzoyl peroxide treatments, R + F offers 2.5% while LRP has 5.5%. However, this LRP set doesn't include sunscreen like the Rodan + Fields set, so you might want to <a href=# class=T3D>buy one separately</a>.</p><p><strong>According to a fan:</strong> “Literally the only brand/product that keeps my skin clear! I have oily/combination skin. Never had compliments on my skin until I started using these. Toner with glycolic acid is fabulous and really makes a noticeable difference with pores.”</p><h2><strong>5. The Best Active Hydration Serum Alternative</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>L'Oreal Paris' 1.5% hyaluronic acid serum </a>is a budget-friendly alternative to <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Rodan + Fields' Active Hydration Serum</a>. Although the concentration isn’t readily available for Rodan + Fields' serum, both products contain <a href=# class=T3D>moisturizing hyaluronic acid</a> to smooth and plump. Both also contain glycerin, another hydrating powerhouse. L’Oréal’s serum is suitable for all skin types and can also pull double duty as a makeup primer.</p><p><strong>According to a fan:</strong> “I tried this to help with hydration in this dry Colorado climate. But as a bonus, after using it for 3 weeks, the puffy pockets at the tops of my cheeks just went away.”</p><h2><strong>6. The Best Active Hydration Body Replenish Alternative</strong></h2><p>Just like the pricy Rodan + Fields Active Hydration Body Replenish, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>CeraVe’s dermatologist-recommended moisturizer </a>is also packed with glycerin, ceramides, and hyaluronic acid to provide long-lasting moisture. Both products promise intense hydration and the prevention of moisture loss. CeraVe’s lightweight formula helps to restore the skin's protective barrier and can work for up to 24 hours. Plus, this lotion in a handy pump is hypoallergenic and free of fragrances and oils, making it a great choice for those with sensitive skin.</p><p><strong>According to a fan:</strong> “My dermatologist suggested using this brand of products. The moisturizing cleanser is so good, my hands and face never feel dry when using. The lotion is light and absorbs quickly. The cream is wonderful for those areas of your body that are so very dry.”</p><h2><strong>7. The Best Redefine Multi-Function Eye Cream Alternative</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Pure Biology's eye cream</a> is packed with moisturizing ingredients, just like Rodan + Fields' cult-favorite Redefine eye cream, at half the price. Both contain glycerin but Pure Biology’s eye cream is also packed with vitamins C and E, argan oil, shea butter, and more. These ingredients work together to soothe the delicate skin around your eyes, aiming to reduce puffiness and brighten dark circles. With thousands of five-star reviews, Pure Biology's best-selling formula has built a following of its own.</p><p><strong>According to a fan:</strong> “I love this eye cream/serum. It's got a great consistency, goes on and sinks in without leaving a shiny wet mess. No noticeable fragrances. No irritation to my very sensitive eyes or skin. I've been using it morning and night for about a week, and have noticed the dark circles are not quite as dark, no puffiness.”</p><h2><strong>8. The Best Redefine Intensive Renewing Serum Alternative</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>RoC's retinol serum</a> powers up your skin’s renewal process with retinol, much like Rodan + Fields' Redefine Intensive Renewing Serum. Luckily for your wallet, RoC does it for less than $20. RoC’s retinol serum is non-greasy and hypoallergenic, and it absorbs quickly. While this serum is gentle enough to use every night, the manufacturer suggests that you start slowly and possibly every other day. Once you know how the product works with your skin, you can increase the frequency as needed.</p><p><strong>According to a fan: </strong>“This got excellent reviews and I'm happy to say it lives up to them. My skin looks fresher. Try it - excellent for the price. Also, well designed with pump and cover.”</p><h2>9. The Best Reverse Intensive Brightening Toner Alternative</h2><p>The <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>BACIEL Hydra Barrier CICA Essence Toner</a> features brightening niacinamide and moisturizing sodium hyaluronate just like the R + F Reverse Intensive Brightening Toner but costs less than half the price. It also features centella asiatica extract which is great for soothing skin and reducing redness as well as amino acids. Plus, since it’s free of fragrance and alcohol, it’s a great pick for those with sensitive skin.</p><p><strong>According to a fan:</strong> “This toner is super hydrating. I sprinkle a bit into the palm of my hand and rub my hands together before gently applying it to my face. It's got the consistency of water, and it absorbs so well without leaving any sticky feeling on the skin.It's like a drink of water for my combination skin, and my face finds it soooo soothing. Love to see the centella in there to assist with repairing the skin barrier.”</p><h2><strong>10. The Best Soothe Rescue Mask Alternative</strong></h2><p>The hero ingredient in R + F’s Soothe Rescue Mask is the same calamine you’d find in a poison ivy cream which makes sense that it helps with irritated skin. <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Etude House’s AC Clean Up Pink Powder Mask</a> also features calamine. And just like the R + F product, it’s a kaolin clay-based formula with moisturizers like glycerin. Best of all, it’s less than $20 and comes in a user-friendly tube.</p><p><strong>According to a fan:</strong> “Whenever my skin is looking a little dull or I start to break out a bit, I use this mask at night for 30-45 minutes and the next day my skin is like butter. I first found this in Japan and was so pumped to see I can buy it here on Amazon.”</p><h2>11. The Best Soothe Moisturizing Rescue Cream Alternative</h2><p>Those with sensitive skin looking for a Soothe moisturizer alternative would be smart to zero in on<a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D> Aveeno’s Calm + Restore Oat Gel face moisturizer</a>. It’s packed with powerful but lightweight moisturizers like glycerin along with the ultra-soothing colloidal oatmeal that’s the star of the R + F product. Plus, it’s fragrance-, alcohol-, and dye-free to reduce the chances of irritation.</p><p><strong>According to a fan: </strong>“I bought this moisturizer after Dr. Dray on YouTube recommended it. I have combination skin type but prone to dehydration; especially during the cold/dry months. I apply this cream as the last step, following toner/serum/essence. It's working perfectly so far. My skin doesn't have that tight feeling after a couple of hours like it normally does. The gel-type cream applies easily and dries down to a semi-matte finish. It's completely fragrance free and very soothing. I feel like my face has a layer of protectiveness on it. I highly recommend it if you have sensitive or any skin types.”</p><h2>12. The Best Active Hydration Bright Eye Complex Alternative</h2><p>R + F’s best-selling Active Hydration Bright Eye Complex cream features a moisturizing blend of glycerin and hyaluronic acid, and blends it with caffeine to brighten.<a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D> Vichy’s fan-favorite Mineral 89 eye serum</a> features all three and is backed by an impressive 4.5-star overall rating after more than 6,000 reviews. The derm-approved brand is also designed to be safe for sensitive skin, and is free of fragrance, alcohol, and mineral oil.</p><p><strong>According to a fan:</strong> “It moisturizes well and seems to brighten up the eye area. I only need a small amount of serum to use under both eyes, and the texture is pleasant - lightweight and creamy. My eyes are sensitive to chemicals and scents, and I don't have any issues with this product.”</p><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p>This article was originally published on July 25, 2020</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunC%2F07KjnmeTnbKivMSrZJqkpJq%2Fr63Toq2eq12pvG6%2Bzp2Yp2WWnrKtsNI%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./zac-efron-just-released-from-the-hospital.html><span>←</span><span>Zac Efron Just Released from the Hospital</span></a>
