Since his unprecedented death, Grande has written several personal <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">songs</a> about the late rapper and the love they shared during their short-lived romance.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Mac-Miller-and-Ariana-Grande.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-ghostin>‘Ghostin’</h2><p id=par-3_44>Off of her fifth studio album, Thank U, Next, “Ghostin” is a song that may not have topped the Billboard music charts like some of Grande’ other tracks, but it is one that put many people in their feelings after they listened to it.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-4_32>In the song, Grande sings to her ex-fiancé Pete Davidson about being haunted by Mac Miller, the titular “ghost” whose presence is too overbearing for either of them to try to deny.</p><p id=par-5_30>She sings, “Though I wish he were here instead/Don’t want that living in your head/ He just comes to visit me/ When I’m dreaming every now and then (And then).”</p><p id=par-6_34>Before the release of Thank U, Next, Grande <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">described</a> “Ghostin” as being about “feeling badly for the person you’re with bc you love somebody else. feeling badly bc he can tell he can’t compare.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-imagine>‘Imagine’</h2><p id=par-7_28>Thank U, Next features several songs believed to be about Miller. The opening track “Imagine” is one many are convinced Grande wrote with the late rapper in mind.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-8_74>In the song, she sings, “Click, click, click and post / Drip-drip-dripped in gold / Quick, quick, quick, let’s go / Kiss me and take off your clothes Imagine a world like that / Imagine a world like that / We go like up ’til I’m ‘sleep on your chest / Love how my face fits so good in your neck / Why can’t you imagine a world like that? / Imagine a world.”</p><p id=par-9_56>While the lyrics might not immediately conjure up images of Miller, Grande did reveal on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter</a> that the song is about “a simple, beautiful love that is now (and forever) unattainable.” Paired with the lyrics of Miller’s 2016 track “Cinderella,” it’s safe to say that the rapper was on her mind when she wrote this song.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-better-off>‘Better Off’</h2><p id=par-10_23>Now, it’s unclear if this song is actually about Miller. However, fans are convinced that it is after giving it a good listen.</p><p id=par-11_16>On the track, which is from her Sweetener album, Grande sings about a “love gone wrong.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-4><p></p></figure><p id=par-12_33>Seeing as she <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">alluded to a troubled relationship</a> with Miller back in May 2018 after the two had broken up, many believe that “Better Off” has the rapper’s name written all over it.</p><p id=par-13_26>Showbiz Cheat Sheet reached out to Grande’s team for confirmation that “Better Off” is about Miller but did not hear back by the time of publication.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-everytime>‘Everytime’</h2><p id=par-14_17>Another track off her Sweetener album that seemed to illustrate a troubled romance was the song “Everytime.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-5><p></p></figure><p id=par-15_31>In it, she sings, “You get high and call on the regular/ I get weak and fall like a teenager/ Why, oh why does God keep bringing me/ Back to you?”</p><p id=par-16_34>It’s been alleged that Miller’s drug use played a part in his split from Grande. Though that has neither been confirmed nor denied, fans think the singer alludes to these issues in the lyrics.</p><p id=par-17_25>Showbiz Cheat Sheet reached out to Grande’s team for confirmation that “Everytime” is about Miller, but did not hear back by the time of publication.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-just-like-magic>‘Just Like Magic’</h2><p id=par-18_53>On her most recent album, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Positions</a>, Grande sings the song “Just Like Magic,” which includes the lyrics: “Good karma my aesthetic (Aesthetic) / Keep my conscience clear, that’s why I’m so magnetic / Manifest it (Yeah), I finessed it (I finessed it) / Take my pen and write some love letters to Heaven.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-6><p></p></figure><p id=par-19_40>According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Capital FM</a>, some fans believe Grande was referencing Miller in the track with one person writing on Twitter, “The Mac Miller reference on ‘Just Like Magic’ has me so f*****g weak. Ariana really breaking me with this album.”</p><p id=par-20_27>Showbiz Cheat Sheet reached out to Grande’s team for confirmation that “Just Like Magic” is about Miller, but did not hear back by the time of publication.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-off-the-table>‘Off The Table’</h2><p id=par-21_23>Though she mostly sang about her relationship with fiancé Dalton Gomez on her Positions album, the record still included personal tributes to Miller.</p><p id=par-22_36>One being in her song <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“Off The Table,”</a> featuring The Weeknd. In the track, Grande sings worries that she might not love again after losing someone she truly cared for, which is believed to be Miller.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-7><p></p></figure><p id=par-23_49>She begins the song by singing: “Will I ever love the same way again? / Will I ever love somebody like the way I did you? / Never thought you’d be so damn hard to replace / […] If I can’t have you, is love completely off the table?”</p><p id=par-24_19>The year after Miller’s death, Grande opened up about losing him to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Vogue</a> magazine, describing her mourning as “all-consuming.”</p><p id=par-25_51>“By no means was what we had perfect, but, like, f*ck. He was the best person ever, and he didn’t deserve the demons he had,” she said. “I was the glue for such a long time, and I found myself becoming…less and less sticky. The pieces just started to float away.”</p><p id=par-26_29>Though she’s since channeled that pain into music, it’s clear that Grande still thinks about Miller regularly as he was and always will be one of her greatest loves.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTEqa3TZpiroZGjrm6z0ZqlnZ1dqLyvs9JmmKudXZavsMHTZqSam12itq24xKtloaydoXw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./taika-waititi-net-worth-career-biography-and-marriage.html><span>←</span><span>Taika Waititi Net Worth, Career , Biography And Marriage</span></a>
