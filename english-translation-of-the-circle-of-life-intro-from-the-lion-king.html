But,&nbsp;those who aren't fluent in the language have likely never understood those lyrics. However, we're in luck, because there's a&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel=nofollow>the translation of the lyrics into English, via Genius</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>"Here comes a lion, father<br>Oh yes it’s a lion</p><p>Here comes a lion, father<br>Oh yes it’s a lion<br>A lion<br>We’re going to conquer<br>A lion<br>A lion and a leopard come to this open place"</p><p>From that point, the song segues into English lyrics. You probably know them by heart.</p><p>As <a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel=nofollow>the Genius annotations</a>&nbsp;explain, it's notable&nbsp;that the opening of the song is sung in Zulu. It's&nbsp;a language of South Africa, while all the characters' names in "The Lion King" are in Swahili, a language of eastern and southeastern Africa. Some of the story's elements also pull from Masai tradition, which has its own language. And so, "The Lion King" is less a product of one nation than of pan-Africanism, and of universal values.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>The lyrics for the opening chant of "Circle of Life" were written by Lebo M, a South African composer brought on to work on the movie's soundtrack by song producer Hans Zimmer, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-product-module=body_link>according to the 1994 documentary "The Making of 'The Lion King."</a></p><p>"We explained to him, it's a story of one lion who loses his father in tragic circumstances and ultimately has to rise up to his responsibility as king," <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-product-module=body_link>director Rob Minkoff said in the documentary</a>. "[His composition] was just magic. It was unbelievable...
