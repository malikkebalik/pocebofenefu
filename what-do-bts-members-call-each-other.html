Jin’s real name <a href=#>is Kim Seokjin</a>. Min Yoongi’s stage name with BTS is Suga. However, when he’s releasing solo music, this artist performs under the stage name Agust D.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-4_31>By contrast, when Jung Hoseok releases solo music, it’s under the same name as his BTS stage name — J-Hope. Kim Namjoon changed his stage name from Rap Monster to RM.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-5_42>Jimin is one of the few BTS members who has his real name as his stage name. Technically, Jungkook’s stage name is somewhat different from his birth name, which is Jeongguk. ARMYs showcase the members’ real names with fan chants at concerts.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-do-the-bts-members-have-nicknames-for-each-other>Do the BTS members have nicknames for each other?</h2><p id=par-6_32>While on stage or during interviews, the BTS members will most likely refer to each other by their birth names and sometimes by their stage names. However, some members earned nicknames.</p><p id=par-7_43>As a play on his birth name, some of the BTS members call J-Hope “Hobi” or just “Hope.” Typically, the younger BTS members also refer to older members as “Hyung,” as a sign of respect and as a tradition in South Korea.</p><p id=par-8_22>“Hyung” roughly translates to “big brother” in Hangul, so members like Jin will often be referred to as “Jin-Hyung” or just “Hyung.”&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-armys-gave-nicknames-to-the-bts-members>ARMYs gave nicknames to the BTS members</h2><p id=par-9_45>It’s been over seven years since this K-pop group debuted. In that time, ARMYs created a few funny nicknames for the seven performers. Because Jungkook is the youngest member a talented singer, dancer, and even painter, some BTS fans nicknamed the artist the “Golden Maknae.”&nbsp;</p><p id=par-10_35>RM earned the nickname the “God of Destruction” because he has a way of breaking things wherever he goes. The group’s singer, “Worldwide Handsome” Jin, earned the nickname “Car Door Guy” for his good looks.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-11_55>Sometimes as a joke, the BTS members call each other by unique nicknames. While doing their Carpool Karaoke segment of The Late Late Show with James Corden, James Corden brought up that some fans call Jimin by the nickname “Mochi.” As a result, RM and the other performers started referring to Jimin as “Baby Mochi.”</p><p id=par-12_33>The “Life Goes On” music video by BTS is now available for streaming on YouTube. The K-pop group’s deluxe album, titled Be, is available on Spotify, Apple Music, and most major streaming platforms.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSvtb%2BMppymmpWnwG6vwKWjZp2RmLVuu9OhnKtmmKm6rXs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./new-photo-shoot-with-hawkeye-actor-jeremy-renner-has-fans-thirsting.html><span>←</span><span>New photo shoot with Hawkeye actor Jeremy Renner has fans thirsting</span></a>
