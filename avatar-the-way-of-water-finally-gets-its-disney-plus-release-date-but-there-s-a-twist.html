Now we‚Äôre about to see it as nature intended: on our tiny phone screens. That‚Äôs right, Disney Plus has finally revealed when we can expect to view the sci-fi sequel phenomenon on streaming.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=452 data-current-count=452 data-injectable=true>Avatar: The Way of Water is officially coming to Disney Plus on June 7. As well as the full three-hour, 12-minute film, those for some reason looking for even more Pandora-set screen time will be able to enjoy bonus content featuring filmmakers, cast, and crew. What‚Äôs more, in a rather unique situation, subscribers to a certain other rival streaming service will likewise be able to watch the movie, as Avatar 2 drops on Max the very same day.</p><p data-characters=447 data-current-count=447 data-injectable=true>The double-dip is most certainly due to a streaming deal put in place between 20th Century Fox and Max before the former was acquired by Walt Disney in 2019. As such, a film that was shown in theaters for nearly three months, grossed $2.32 billion at the box office, and became the third highest-grossing movie of all time will also have the chance to get in front of double the number of phone screens and living rooms. It only makes sense.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Return to Pandora üíô<br><a href=#>#AvatarTheWayOfWater</a> is streaming on <a href=#>@disneyplus</a> June 7. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/Daepq1FuSQ</a></p>‚Äî Avatar (@officialavatar) <a href=#>May 15, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=398 data-current-count=698 data-injectable=true>Although June 7 marks the film‚Äôs official Disney Plus (and Max) debut, the movie has been <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">available to stream</a> as far back as March 29. At that time, the sequel was bogged down by the familiar tidal wave of complaints it received the first time around back in 2009, which ranged from its exorbitantly long run time to its cookie-cutter storyline. This time, however, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the complaints have doubled</a>.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=389 data-current-count=389 data-injectable=false>Indeed, despite its astronomical financial success, the film has occupied a mysterious realm of ambiguity. People either love it <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">or they hate it</a>, like most other insanely popular films. There is no shortage of opinions, just like there will be no shortage of moviegoers tuning in to watch the sci-fi spectacular now that it‚Äôs available to stream from our tiny little phone screens.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=156 data-current-count=545 data-injectable=false>Whether you like it or not, Avatar: The Way of Water will be available to stream on Disney Plus starting June 7.
