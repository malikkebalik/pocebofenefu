Rumors started circulating that the reality star had a sex tape. Five years later, Mackenzie admits she was “so naive to the situation,” and says she was “set up.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Mackenzie-McKee.png><h2>Mackenzie McKee on what happened with her 2015 sex tape</h2><p id=par-2_20>On July 23, Mackenzie spoke to The Domenick Nati Show about what really happened with her alleged sex tape.</p><p id=par-3_38>“There was a rumor on the internet that I had a sex tape and I completely 100% got set up with that,” she said, adding that she was “told it was going to make [her] Christianity look good.”&nbsp;</p><p id=par-4_43>Back in 2015, Mackenzie told <a href=#>The Ashley</a> that someone had stolen her phone and that’s how an R-rated video of her and <a href=#>her husband Josh</a> got out. Vivid Entertainment wanted to pay Mackenzie for the video, but she said she wasn’t interested.</p><p id=par-5_27>Mackenzie told Nati that some of the people she was working with at the time said the tape could be good for her career and image. &nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-6_62>“The producer I was working with said, ‘No, people know you as a Christian and now you’re gonna make millions and you’re going to be a famous spokesperson and motivational speaker for girls to not ever send boys, their boyfriends, nude photos or anything,’” said the reality star, adding that being a motivational speaker is something she’s always wanted to do.</p><p id=par-7_28>Despite saying previously that a video of her and Josh was taken from her phone, Mackenzie also still maintains that she’s never made a sex tape.</p><p id=par-8_24>“I wouldn’t dare,” she said. “I don’t even send Josh nude photos. That’s not something I stand for. That’s not something I’d ever do.”</p><h2>How Josh McKee reacted to the Mackenzie sex tape rumors</h2><p id=par-9_34>In 2015, it was reported that Josh was so upset with Mackenzie for meeting with Vivid Entertainment that he left. Today, Mackenzie says she understands why Josh was so affected by the situation.</p><p id=par-10_69>“When that came out I think he literally just wanted to crawl into a dark hole and disappear forever. He was so embarrassed. That was his wife and that was out there. None of it was true. I was just like, ‘Oh Josh, shut up. Just get over it.’ And then years later he brought that up in counseling and was like, ‘This really hurt me,’” she said. &nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-11_73>“Who wants a rumor about his wife? His family has had to see all this. His family has had to see a rumor about me having a sex tape and me destroying their son’s name online. I can only imagine the damage that I have done. Even my family doesn’t like it. They are team Josh. They are like, ‘Why? Why would you do this stuff that you did?’” Mackenzie continued.</p><p id=par-12_30>Today, <a href=#>Mackenzie and Josh aren’t together</a>. Though Josh has yet to sign the divorce papers, the reality star says they’re no longer living together or wearing their wedding rings.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTBprHNZqSopV2irqS3xKexop1dorCsscRmpJqjlWK6qrjLoqanq12osrl505qnnmWjlsa0edKhnGavkah6tLHTZqypZpipuq17</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./greg-ginn-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Greg Ginn Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</span></a>
