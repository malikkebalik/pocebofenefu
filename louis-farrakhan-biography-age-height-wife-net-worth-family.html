An enigmatic and charismatic public figure, Farrakhan continues to grow in stature. He continues to be one of the most vocal critics of institutional racism, and he remains equally critical of Black Americans who take no personal or collective responsibility for their social, political, and economic circumstances. He is fervently devoted to Islam and is fluent in Arabic, an ability that he used when he assisted Jesse Jackson's negotiations with the Syrian government for the release of Navy Lieutenant Robert O. Goodman, Jr.</p><p>Reconciled in 1994 with Dr. <a href=#>Betty Shabazz</a>, the widow of <a href=#>Malcolm X</a>, who had once believed that he somehow instigated the assassination of her husband.</p><p>Appeared on the compilation CD: "The Charmer is Louis Farrakhan Calpyso Favorites: 1953-1954"</p><p>Noted for his fiery and controversial rhetoric on race relations, Farrakhan came under the influence of Nation of Islam minister <a href=#>Malcolm X</a> in the late 1950s. He joined the Nation of Islam after having given up a rather successful musical career as a calypso singer known as "The Charmer". He remains an avid music lover and is considered by many to be an expert classical violinist, citing the composer Felix Mendelssohn as one of his favorite composers. After controversial remarks about Jewish Americans during the first Presidential campaign of <a href=#>Jesse Jackson</a>, Farrakhan has continuously had to defend and/or explain himself to media organs whom many of his supporters believe misconstrue or erroneously report on the Nation of Islam leader.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmsmZeaxKq3yGeaqKVfoby2tdJmnZqqopa4qa3N</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./hire-yung-gravy-for-a-corporate-event-or-performance-booking.html><span>←</span><span>Hire Yung Gravy for a Corporate Event or Performance Booking.</span></a>
