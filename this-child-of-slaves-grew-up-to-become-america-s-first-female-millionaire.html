<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>This Child of Slaves Grew Up to Become America's First Female Millionaire</h1></header><section class=post-content><p class=p1>America is considered to be the "land of opportunity". Historically, it's the country people have run to in order to escape persecution, poor living conditions, or lack of opportunities somewhere else. However, for the large number of African people stolen from their homes, shipped across the Atlantic, and sold into slavery, America was anything but a land of opportunity. So it's pretty darn incredible that America's first female self-made millionaire, <strong>Madam C.J. Walker</strong>, was the child of former slaves. Her story is one of perseverance, ingenuity, and triumph. If her amazing life doesn't make you want to get off your butt and go make your dreams happen, than nothing will.</p><p class=p1>Madam C.J. Walker, also known as <strong>Sarah Breedlove</strong>, was born on December 23, 1867, just outside of Delta, Louisiana. She was born on the cotton plantation where her family had been enslaved. She held the distinction of being the first free-born child in the family. The youngest of five, she was the first person in her family born after the signing of the Emancipation Proclamation. However, by age 7, she was orphan. Both of her parents passed away within a year of each other. Their cause of death was not recorded. She was sent to live with her older sister in Mississippi, where it is believed she worked picking cotton and doing housework. Her life in Mississippi was anything but ideal, and though slavery had technically been abolished, most people in the South had yet to "get the memo", as it were. She worked the same hours she would have worked as a slave and was paid a pittance. Then, she and her family members had to pay exorbitant fees to live in the very same shack that her sister had lived in while she was a slave. Making matters worse, was that her brother-in-law was physically abusive. Eventually, she couldn't take it anymore. At 14, she married a man named Moses McWilliams, mostly in an effort to get away from her current living situation.</p><p class=p1></p><p class=p1>The pair had a baby in 1885. Two years later, Moses passed away, and Sarah and her daughter A'Lelia moved to St. Louis to be closer to Sarah's older brothers. Her brothers had found some success working as barbers. In St. Louis, she began working as a washerwoman. Her pay was only $1.50 per day. She used the majority of the money to pay for her daughter's schooling, and also took whatever classes she could herself. She subsequently met and married Charles J. Walker. Mr. Walker worked in advertising and their relationship would prove to be a fortuitous one.</p><p class=p1>Due to a severe scalp condition, most likely caused by the lye-based products used to straighten her hair, Sarah Breedlove had begun to lose her hair in bunches. Whenever she had a spare moment in her kitchen, she began making her own hair care products, and experimenting with ways to treat her own scalp. A black woman named <strong>Annie Turnbo Malone</strong> heard about Sarah. Ms. Malone made and marketed her own line of African-American hair care products. She invited Sarah to come work for her as a commission agent. So Sarah, Charles, and A'Lelia relocated to Denver, Colorado and launched a hair care business under Ms. Malone. At the urging of her husband, Sarah changed her professional name to Madam C.J. Walker, and launched her business in earnest. Between her genuinely effective and well-made products and her husband's advertising acumen, her business grew by leaps and bounds. The couple spent much of the early 1900s, traveling around selling her products all over the south. By 1908, she was able to go out on her own. She opened a factory and her own beauty school in Pittsburgh.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-237210 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Screen-Shot-2017-11-05-at-9.58.16-AM.png alt width=768 height=736 sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-237210 class=wp-caption-text>Photo via Smithsonian Institution, National Museum of American History : Archives Center/Wikimedia Commons</p><p class=p1>The company continued to grow, so Sarah, now Madam C.J., moved operations to Indianapolis. She began training a group of employees who were both salespeople and beauticians. Known as "<strong>Walker Agents</strong>", these African-American entrepreneurs began selling her products all over the United States. She began sponsoring conventions, sales awards, and community events. She and her husband divorced in 1913, and rather than slowing her down, it seemed to galvanize her. She traveled to the Caribbean and Latin America, adding more and more "Walker Agents" to her roster and increasing her sales base. By this time, her daughter A'Lelia, had begun to take charge of some portions of operations. A'Lelia purchased prime real estate in Harlem and made it the new base of operations for <strong>Madam C. J. Walker Manufacturing</strong>. As more responsibility was shifted to her daughter, Madam C.J. Walker began focusing on philanthropy and community improvement. She created scholarship funds, sponsored the building and maintenance of multiple homes for the elderly, donated large sums to both the NAACP and the National Conference on Lynching, and, in 1913, donated the largest amount of money by an African-American to the Indianapolis YMCA.</p><p class=p1>She built a home in Irvington-on-Hudson, New York sometime around 1916 or 1917, and passed away there in 1919, due to hypertension. She was 51 years old. She was the sole owner of Madam C.J. Walker Manufacturing for most of its existence, and the company was worth <strong>over $1 million</strong> when she died. Additionally, she was worth close to <strong>$700,000</strong> herself, separate from the company. That's the equivalent of <strong>$13 million</strong> in today's dollars. It was an astronomical amount in 1919.</p><p class=p1>At the time of her death in 1919, Madam C.J. Walker was the wealthiest African-American in the United States. She was also generally believed to the country's first self-made female multi-millionaire. Assuming her net worth was approximately $2 million the year she died, that would be equivalent to <strong>$37 million today</strong>.</p><p class=p1>When she died, her&nbsp;will dictated that<strong> 2/3 of all future company profits</strong> be donated to charity from that point on. One third of her estate went to her daughter. Her home in Irvington-on-Hudson is now a registered landmark, and the arts center named after her in Indianapolis, the Walker Center, has become nationally famous.</p><p class=p1>Madam C.J. Walker, aka Sarah Breedlove, went from absolutely nothing, to wealthier than just about everyone else around her. Along the way, she made sure to give back to the community that supported her, and trained hundreds of "Walker Agents" about entrepreneurship, civic duty, and pride. She proved to an entire generation of African-Americans, many of whom had grown up enslaved, that success was possible. Historically and socially, the example she set has proven far more valuable than her millions of dollars.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcLHNrZyrrJGeu66xza1kmqqknrCtsdJomqGhnJl6tLjAr5ysZZensrh5wZ6aqKWVYq6usdGimpqrXZu2s7%2FTZp2epZGhsm65yKWjoqeelrazsY4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-highest-grossing-nightclubs-in-america-2015.html><span>←</span><span>The Highest Grossing Nightclubs In America2015</span></a>
