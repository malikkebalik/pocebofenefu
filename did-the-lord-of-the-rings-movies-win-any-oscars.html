Although The Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers took home prizes for Sound Editing, Special Effects, and Cinematography, they didn’t snag any wins in the major awards categories.</p><p id=par-3_57>That changed with The Return of the King, which won the series a whopping total of 11 Academy Awards. To this day, The Return of the King is among the <a href=#>films that have received the most Oscars</a>. Even more impressively, it took home Best Picture — the first fantasy movie to ever accomplish such a feat.</p><p id=par-4_21>What other Oscars did The Lord of the Rings movies win?

In fact, many of them weren’t even nominated for their roles.</p><p id=par-11_39><a href=#>Sir Ian McKellen</a> was the only contender, receiving a Best Supporting Actor nomination for The Fellowship of the Ring. However, even Gandalf the Grey’s sacrifice at the end of the film wasn’t enough to take home a win.</p><p id=par-12_64>Fortunately, the Lord of the Rings cast made up for it at other awards ceremonies. According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">IMDb</a>, McKellen won Outstanding Male Actor in a Supporting Role at the 2002 SAG Awards. And two years later, the entirety of the cast won the SAG for Outstanding Cast in a Motion Picture. That’s just one of several ensemble achievements they took home over the years.</p><p id=par-13_36>Elijah Wood also received a handful of honors for playing Frodo, including an MTV Award. And Viggo Mortensen and Andy Serkis are among the other major cast members to receive solo accolades at various ceremonies.</p><p id=par-14_37>Even without any acting Oscars, The Lord of the Rings left its mark on the industry. And the movies made Academy Awards history in other ways, paving the way for genre films to receive greater recognition.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSxqrCMpaarnF2ks27Ax55kq6GenMBuuc6voJ6rXay2r3nAp7Bmp6OYrrO%2FjaGrpqRf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./willard-eugene-pietila-accident-68-years-old-willard-eugene-pietila-fatally-struck-on-hwy-34-in-pa.html><span>←</span><span>Willard Eugene Pietila Accident; 68 Years Old, Willard Eugene Pietila Fatally Struck On Hwy 34 In Pa</span></a>
