Almost every year, there are a handful of big name players from the college and international ranks that dominate the headlines and 24 hour media cycle. This year though, the NBA Draft's biggest name isn't a player at all; it's <a href=#><strong>Lavar Ball</strong></a>, the father of a player who is expected to be one of the top picks in this year's draft; <a href=# title="Lonzo Ball Net Worth">Lonzo Ball</a>. To say that Lavar has made some outlandish comments in the past may be an understatement, but his most recent comments may have taken the cake.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>In an interview with Fox Sport's 1's 'The Herd with <a href=# title="Colin Cowherd Net Worth">Colin Cowherd</a>," Lavar Ball revealed that he sold around 400 to 500 pairs of his $495 ZO2 shoes that he launched two weeks ago. When asked about the big shoe companies, Ball replied that they would regret not agreeing to a deal with him after his son is drafted by the only team he wants his son on; the Los Angeles Lakers.</span></p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-223879 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/GettyImages-653455710.jpg alt width=900 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-223879 class=wp-caption-text>(Josh Lefkowitz/Getty Images)</p><p class=p1><span class=s1>"Now that Lonzo's headed to Los Angeles, what they should have done is give me a billion dollars and let me be on my way," said Lonzo. And he didn't stop there. "Now you know … if they want to talk to me now, it just went up to $3 billion. Triple B's — billion, billion, billion," he said, adding: "That's the only way they going to come at me. I'm already in the building. I don't need them for nothing, as you can tell."</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>To put that $3 billion amount into perspective, the lifetime deal <a href=#>LeBron James</a> signed with Nike last year is reportedly worth $1 billion.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Later on in the interview, Ball had a tense exchange with Fox Sports reporter <a href=# title="Kristine Leahy Net Worth">Kristine Leahy</a> in which Leahy argued that if Big Baller Brand wants to be successful, the company has to market its products to women.
