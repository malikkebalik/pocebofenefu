He will not return as a series regular in season 10, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Deadline</a> reported. It’s not known if Rains might make a guest appearance next season.&nbsp;Rains’ exit follows the departure of Nick Gehlfuss as Dr. Will Halstead and Brian Tee as Dr. Ethan Choi in season 8.</p><p id=par-3_66>The Chicago Med Season 9 finale set the stage for Crockett’s departure from <a href=#>Gaffney Chicago Medical Center</a> when he spiraled into crisis following the death of one of his young patients and the subsequent suicide of the boy’s father. The situation unlocked Crockett’s unresolved grief over his own daughter’s death from cancer, and hospital head Sharon Goodwin (S. Epatha Merkerson) told him to take time off.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-4_31>While Rains is on his way out, three longtime Chicago Med cast members will return next season. Merkerson, Oliver Platt, and Marlyne Barrett will appear in season 10, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TVLine</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-changes-are-coming-to-other-one-chicago-shows>Changes are coming to other One Chicago shows&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Chicago-PD-Season-11-Tracy-Spiridakos.webp?strip=all&quality=80"><p id=par-5_28>Rains’ departure isn’t the only change coming to Chicago Med. Co-showrunners Diane Frolov and Andy Schneider are stepping down after nine years. They’ll be replaced by Allen MacDonald.</p><p id=par-6_12>Change is also in the air at the other One Chicago shows.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-7_55>Longtime Chicago Fire cast member Eamonn Walker is exiting as a series regular after 12 seasons. He’s played Chief Wallace Boden since the show premiered in 2012. Kara Killmer, who played Sylvie Brett, and Alberto Rosende, who played Blake Gallo, left earlier in season 12, while Jocelyn Hudon joined the show as paramedic Lyla Novak.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-8_34>Meanwhile, Chicago P.D. fans have had to bid farewell to <a href=#>Tracy Spiridakos</a>, who has played Detective Hailey Upton since 2017. Her last episode was the show’s season 11 finale, which aired in May 2024.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-9_92>“It was a really hard decision, and I don’t know that there’s ever a right time,” Spiridakos told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">NBC Insider</a> of her decision to leave Chicago P.D. “I think I’ve been on the show for just over seven years, like seven and a half-ish years, and I was just wanting to switch it up and kind of see what else was out there. That was really it. I’m so close with everybody. With our producers, Gwen, our writers, our cast, our crew. It was a really difficult and emotional time, for sure.”</p><p id=par-10_24>Though cast changes can be jarring for viewers, they’re to be expected when shows last as long as Chicago Med and its sister series.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-11_38>“Cast comes in, cast goes out…,” Jeff Bader, President of Program Planning Strategy for NBCUniversal Entertainment, recently told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TVLine</a>. “We’re thrilled with how the Chicagos do on Wednesday. We have no plans on changing anything on that night.”</p><p id=par-12_17>Chicago Med, Chicago Fire, and Chicago P.D. will also return with new episodes on NBC this fall.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-13_6>Chicago Med is streaming on Peacock.</p><p id=par-14_16>For more on the entertainment world and exclusive interviews, subscribe to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Showbiz Cheat Sheet’s YouTube channel</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSwor%2FTZqSepZKav264xJqtoqaXYrCptcKanqhlnZqxbr%2FEmqqopl1mfW%2B006ajaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-happened-to-sen-sick-kyedae-drama-age-and-wiki-details.html><span>←</span><span>What Happened To Sen Sick?
