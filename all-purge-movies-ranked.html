Here’s our ranking of every movie in The Purge franchise from worst to best:</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-5-the-purge-2013 data-injectable=false>5. The Purge (2013)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/the-purge.jpg><p data-characters=262 data-current-count=262 data-injectable=false>The first movie is considered the worst of the bunch, but it’s not without its merits. The story, while simple, is effective in setting up the world of the Purge. And while the acting and directing are nothing to write home about, they’re serviceable enough.</p><p data-characters=397 data-current-count=659 data-injectable=true>It follows the Sandin family as they hunker down in their home during the annual Purge, a 12-hour period during which all crime is legal. Things go awry when one of the family members lets a stranger into their home, setting off a chain of events that leads to violence and bloodshed. While it’s not a great movie, it’s an effective introduction to the world where The Purge movies take place.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>4. The Forever Purge (2021)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/the-forever-purge.jpg><p data-characters=215 data-current-count=515 data-injectable=true>Ranking fourth on the list is The Forever Purge. This is the most recent movie in the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">series</a> and was released in July 2021. It is also the only movie that is not set on the night of the Purge, but instead set after.</p><p data-characters=433 data-current-count=433 data-injectable=true>The Forever Purge follows a group of people who get stranded at a gas station during the final hours of the last Purge. They are then forced to fight for their lives when a group of marauders arrives, intent on killing them all. It was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">not well-received by critics</a>, with many calling it a “mess” and “disjointed.” However, fans enjoyed it and found it to be an entertaining addition, if not a little mindless.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>3. The First Purge (2018)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/the-first-purge.jpg><p data-characters=461 data-current-count=761 data-injectable=true>The First Purge is the fourth movie in The Purge franchise, but it’s actually a prequel that details how the annual event started. Despite some interesting ideas, the film is ultimately let down by its execution and lack of scares. Nonetheless, it’s still a fun watch if you’re a fan of the series, since it fleshes out the lore of The Purge universe and sets up the events of the other movies. Plus, it has a great cast and some intense action sequences.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>2. The Purge: Anarchy (2014)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/the-purge-anarchy.jpg><p data-characters=390 data-current-count=690 data-injectable=true><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Purge: Anarchy</a> is considered the second-best movie of the franchise by many. It features a more expansive plot than its predecessor. Plus, it has some great action sequences that are well-choreographed. The Purge: Anarchy tells the stories of several people who are caught out in the open during the annual Purge, surviving the night as they are pursued by a group of masked vigilantes.</p><p data-characters=234 data-current-count=234 data-injectable=false>The movie does a good job of building up suspense and keeping the viewers on the edge of their seats. It is also one of the few Purge movies that actually has a meaningful message to give (but we’ll let you discover what it is).</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>1. The Purge: Election Year (2016)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/the-purge-election-year.jpg><p data-characters=282 data-current-count=282 data-injectable=false>Many deem The Purge: Election Year as the best among the five Purge movies, since it is the most action-packed, socially relevant, and suspenseful. The movie revolves around the presidential election during a time when an annual Purge event threatens the lives of American citizens.</p><p data-characters=296 data-current-count=578 data-injectable=false>You will enjoy the movie’s clever plot, strong acting performances, and themes of hope and democracy. The body count is also high and there are plenty of suspenseful moments to keep you on the edge of your seat. The plot remains relevant to the social and political climate of modern times.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJomKWkXaXCs7PEZqSorpmawG6%2BwKeinpxf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./actress-kim-fields-net-worth-and-whether-she-s-rooting-for-a-living-single-reboot.html><span>←</span><span>Actress Kim Fields' Net Worth and Whether She's Rooting for a 'Living Single' Reboot</span></a>
