Riding a wave of global fanfare, excitement and hype, Coinbase went public on April 14, 2021. It has been a bumpy 13 months.

With a direct listing, there are no investment banks or pools of wealthy investors promising to create a market for the stock once it goes public. Instead the company's shares are essentially just hoisted onto an exchange, in this case the NASDAQ, for investors to buy immediately at whatever price the market makes.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Mel B was encouraged to leave her abusive husband by Simon Cowell</h2><time>Aug 9, 2024</time>
