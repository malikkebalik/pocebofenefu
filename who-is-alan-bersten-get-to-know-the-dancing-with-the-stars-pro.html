Alan has been practicing nearly his whole life for this moment, as he began dancing when he was just a kid.</p><p>The handsome hunk was born and raised in a Russian household in Minnesota. According to Alan, his mom and dad were very persistent in their hopes that their children would pursue careers as professional dancers.</p><p>“My parents wanted me and my brother and sister to start dancing, but they had never danced in their lives,” he told <a href=#>MPLS St. Paul</a> magazine in 2018. “They found a ballroom dance studio, but it really wasn’t good enough. So they took a weird risk and opened a dance studio for us.”</p><p>After starting lessons at the age of 7, Alan quickly fell in love with the sport. “It was just a big family community we had … and it was a lot of fun,” he gushed to the outlet. “I’ve never looked back.”</p><p>Alan was first noticed for his incredible talent when he was cast as a contestant on Fox’s 10th season of <a href=#>So You Think You Can Dance</a> in 2013. Sadly, he only made it to the final 12 before he got eliminated. Although he didn’t win the hit dancing competition, his gig on SYTYCD was a turning point in Alan’s life.</p><p>“In ballroom dancing, there are competitions every weekend, and I really didn’t even think I was that good when I was younger,” he explained to MPLS St. Paul. “Looking back on it, it was just something that I did, I didn’t think of making a career out of it. Then I auditioned for SYTYCD. At that point I was like, ‘Wow, maybe I could do this, I could pursue this as a career.'”</p><p>Following his run on SYTYCD, Alan joined DWTS as a troupe dancer in 2015. Each season, the show has a group of professional dancers, called the troupe, who perform on the show but are not paired with celebrity partners.</p><p>Although he remained as a troupe dancer for four years, fans got to see Alan appear on the show many times throughout. In season 22, he danced a salsa with martial artist <strong>Paige VanZant</strong> after <a href=#><strong>Mark Ballas</strong> </a>suffered a back sprain, as well as filled in and danced with actress <a href=#><strong>Heather Morris</strong></a> for four weeks at the time <a href=#><strong>Maksim Chmerkovskiy</strong></a> was recovering from an injury in season 24.</p><p>The following year in 2017, Alan was officially cast as a professional dancer and was partnered with Broadway actress <a href=#><strong>Debbie Gibson</strong></a> in season 25. Since then, Alan has starred as a beloved pro-partner on the show in every season since. Now that he’s back for season 30, look for him to be partnered with The Talk cohost <strong>Amanda Kloots</strong>. These two could go all the way, as Amanda is a former Radio City Rockette with a Broadway dance background.</p><p><strong>Scroll through the gallery below to learn more about Alan.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46ao5qmXZeys7%2FTnqVmnJGjsKq6xmauoqyYYsGpsYysq5qqo2J%2Bc4SWcWpo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./todd-mcfarlane-s-3-million-mark-mcgwire-70th-home-run-ball-has-dropped-significantly-in-value.html><span>←</span><span>Todd McFarlane's $3 Million Mark McGwire 70th Home Run Ball Has Dropped Significantly In Value</span></a>
