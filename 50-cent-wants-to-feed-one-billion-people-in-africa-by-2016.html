<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>50 Cent Wants To Feed One Billion People In Africa By 2016</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>The average person wouldn't put famine relief and <strong>50 Cent</strong> in the same sentence.&nbsp; The rap artist, entrepreneur, and occasional actor, is primarily known for churning out hit songs, and for his "beefs" with various other artists.&nbsp; Not to mention surviving nine gunshots at close range.&nbsp; He has also become one of the rap world's most successful businesspeople.&nbsp; He currently has a <strong>net worth of $260 million</strong>.&nbsp; His rocky road to success is the stuff of legends.&nbsp; Though he now owns property in multiple cities, and controls a veritable entertainment and retail empire, his rough early years in the business still somewhat overshadow what he has managed to build.&nbsp; Consequently, famine relief and 50 Cent have very little chance of being paired up in anyone's mind.&nbsp; However, they should be.&nbsp; Here's how a rapper, who was at one point "blacklisted" from the US recording industry, has gone on to become a successful artist, businessperson, and interestingly, philanthropist.&nbsp; Still can't quite wrap your head around 50 Cent and famine relief?&nbsp; Well, get used to it, because 50 Cent has plans…</p><p><a href=#>50 Cent</a>, also known as Curtis Jackson III, was born in South Jamaica, Queens, New York on July 6, 1975.&nbsp; His mother was 15 when she gave birth to him and his early years were rough.&nbsp; His mother passed away when he was 8, and he went to live with his grandparents.&nbsp; He began boxing when he was in fifth grade, and began dealing drugs when he was in middle school.&nbsp; Though he had major potential as a boxer, and went on to compete in the Junior Olympics, his plans to focus on boxing were ultimately derailed by his drug-selling business.&nbsp; After he set off a metal detector at his high school, he confessed to peddling drugs, and was sent off to a boot camp for troubled teens.&nbsp; After completing his time at the boot camp, he adopted the name 50 Cent, and began recording tracks in his friend's basement.&nbsp; <a href=# title="Jam Master Jay Net Worth">Jam Master Jay</a> of Run-D.M.C. took an interest in the young rapper, and taught him how to write and structure songs.&nbsp; He recorded an entire album that was ultimately never released.&nbsp; Then he signed with Columbia Records and began working on a new album.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-234772 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/africa-1.jpg alt width=594 height=414 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-234772 class=wp-caption-text>David Becker/Getty Images</p><p>In 2000, he was shot nine times at close range while getting in to his car in front of his grandmother's house.&nbsp; He somehow survived and spent the next five months getting back on his feet.&nbsp; He signed a publishing deal with Columbia while he was recovering, and intended to hit the ground running once he was able to move around better.&nbsp; However, his track, "Ghetto Qu'ran", ruffled all the wrong feathers.&nbsp; Columbia dropped him and no one would record with him.&nbsp; He set out for Canada and recorded thirty tracks there.&nbsp; He released each track carefully and strategically culminating in his 2002 mixtape, "Guess Who's Back".&nbsp; His audience began to grow exponentially, and later that year, he was invited to meet with <a href=#>Eminem</a> and <a href=#>Dr. Dre</a>.&nbsp; His debut studio album, "Get Rich or Die Tryin'", was a hit right out of the gate.&nbsp; It sold almost a million copies in four days, and the track "In da Club", became the most listened-to song in its first week, in radio history.&nbsp; Interscope was so pleased with his success that they allowed him to launch his own label, G-Unit Records.&nbsp; The rap artist was now also a businessman.&nbsp; Over the course of the next ten years, he would go on to release four more albums, and to launch his own entertainment empire in the same vein as <a href=# title="Jay-Z Net Worth">Jay-Z</a> and Dr. Dre.&nbsp; The clothing arm of G-Unit, G-Unit Clothing Company partnered with Reebok from 2003-2008.&nbsp; He partnered with Coca-Cola and Glaceau to create a signature Vitamin Water flavor.&nbsp; He has also partnered with Right Guard and Steiner Sports.&nbsp; He now has two production companies, is a licensed boxing promoter, and oversees G-Unit Books, a Time Warner imprint.&nbsp; To date, he has published two books and a graphic novel.&nbsp; He has become quite, quite wealthy, and owns property in multiple cities.</p><p>However, in 2011, he suddenly shifted his focus to philanthropic activities.&nbsp; While he'd donated large amounts to various charities off and on over the years, 2011 was the first year that he took greater initiative.&nbsp; He helped launch Street King energy drink, in collaboration with Pure Growth Partners.&nbsp; Every time a bottle of Street King is purchased, a portion of the money goes towards feeding a child who would otherwise not have access to enough food.&nbsp; The project arose out of 50 Cent's pledge to feed <strong>one billion people</strong> in Africa between 2011 and 2016.&nbsp; The SK Energy Shot, as it is now known, was ranked the #1 energy drink by Product of the Year in both 2013 and 2014.&nbsp; The company is, by all accounts, a success, and has reportedly provided millions of meals to needy children at this point.</p><p>50 Cent survived a childhood that involved drugs, violence, and juvenile detention.&nbsp; He survived nine gunshot wounds and made an almost complete recovery.&nbsp; He salvaged his recording career after being turned away from every studio.&nbsp; He built a company that has its fingers in everything from filmmaking to boxing to video games.&nbsp; Finally, he has made a concerted effort to give back, and to make the world a better place.&nbsp; The latter is something that all rap artists could do more often.&nbsp; When it comes to philanthropic work, he is a trailblazer within the hip hop community.&nbsp; He says that his son inspires him to be a better person.&nbsp; Whatever the impetus, here's hoping he continues to be generous.&nbsp; He seems able to succeed at whatever he puts his mind to, and now it seems that he's put his mind to saving the world.&nbsp; So… 50 Cent and famine relief do actually go hand-in-hand.&nbsp; I guess we'll all just have to get used to it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcLHNrZyrrJGeu66xza1kmqqknrCtsdJom6impGLBqbXNpGSfmZ2eu6Z50Z6jop2WYoJxecKepa1ll6R6tbvGnquhnaJiwam1zaRm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rick-hendrick-net-worth-racing-career-lifestyle-cars.html><span>←</span><span>Rick Hendrick Net Worth: Racing Career, Lifestyle &amp;amp;
