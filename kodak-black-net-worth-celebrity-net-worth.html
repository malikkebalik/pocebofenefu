He got into increasingly severe trouble starting in 2015 when he was arrested in Pompano Beach and charged with robbery, battery, false imprisonment of a child, and possession of cannabis. The following year, Black was arrested and charged with possession of a weapon by a convicted felon and fleeing from officers; he was arrested again a month later and charged with armed robbery and false imprisonment. In August of 2016, he appeared in court and pleaded no contest to all charges. Under a plea agreement, he assented to one year of house arrest, five years of probation, performing community service, and taking anger management classes. Before Black was released from jail, police found two outstanding criminal warrants, one related to felony criminal sexual conduct in South Carolina and the other to misdemeanor marijuana possession in Florida. Black spent 120 days in jail in Florida before going to South Carolina to face the sexual assault charges. Around the time of his trial, he was arrested for violating his probation. Black was ultimately indicted by a grand jury in South Carolina. Not long after that, he was sentenced to 364 days in jail for violating his house arrest.</p><p>In early 2018, Black was arrested at his Florida home on multiple charges related to an Instagram live-feed of him distributing a gun and marijuana around a small child. He was ultimately sentenced to 364 days in prison with credit for time served. Later, in 2019, Black was arrested upon reentering the United States and charged with third-degree criminal possession of a weapon and unlawful possession of marijuana. Shortly after that, he was arrested again on firearm charges, and was charged with making a false statement on a governmental form related to a firearms purchase. Black was sentenced to 46 months in prison. Alongside that sentence, he was to serve between two and seven years for his earlier firearms possession charge. However, Black soon received a presidential pardon and was released in early 2021. With his sexual assault case still standing, he accepted a plea deal for 18 months of probation. After failing a drug test in mid-2021 which violated his release terms, Black was ordered to enter rehab for 90 days.</p><p>In January 20220 Kodak was granted a commutation for his previous 46-month sentence by departing President <a href=# title="Donald Trump Net Worth">Donald Trump</a>.</p><p>In July 2022, Kodak Black was arrested for trespassing in Pompano Beach, Florida. In July, his vehicle was stopped for dark window tint. Police then detected the smell of marijuana and searched the car finding 31 oxycodone tablets and nearly $75,000 in cash. He was charged with trafficking and possession of a controlled substance. Kodak Black was placed on house arrest after the arrest was said to be in violation of his supervised release.</p><p>After failing to show for a mandatory check in, Kodak Black went to court in June 2023. He then argued in court to get rid of the stringent pretrial supervision. The judge agreed but upped his bond from $75,000 to $250,000, which is why Black had to go through the booking process again in jail. He was in and out in under an hour, and now Kodak will be able to travel and tour without restriction.</p><p>On December 7, 2023 Kodak was arrested yet again. This time he was arrested in Plantation, Florida on charges of cocaine possession and evidence tampering. On the evening of his arrest, police witnessed a black Bentley SUV blocking a road. An officer approached the vehicle and found Kodak asleep in the driver's seat with a strong odor of marijuana coming from the car. Police allegedly found marijuana, a Styrofoam cup that smelled of alcohol and Kodak allegedly had a mouth full of white powder in an apparent attempt to conceal evidence. The white powder allegedly was later found to be cocaine.</p><h2 id=personal-life><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>In 2018, Black had his name legally changed to Bill Kahan Kapri. In June, he earned his GED while in prison.</p><p>In 2022, Kodak Black was shot during a fight outside an Italian restaurant in Los Angeles where <a href=# title="Justin Bieber Net Worth">Justin Bieber</a> was having a Super Bowl party.</p><h2 id=real-estate><strong>Real Estate</strong></h2><p>In February 2023, Kodak Black paid $1.8 million for a 0.7-acre commercial property in Pompano Beach, Florida. The site features two buildings from the 1950s, one a 3,800 square foot structure and the other a 4,900 square foot structure.</p><p>His primary home is in Hollywood, Florida. He paid $557,000 for his house in 2018.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR70aKaoZ2jqXqzrc%2BpnKurX6C8pa3KZpmlmZOgeq%2Bx02auqKqknXw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kaohsiung-shore-excursions-cruise-excursions.html><span>←</span><span>Kaohsiung Shore Excursions &amp;amp; Cruise Excursions</span></a>
