And not at all figuratively. While talking about his newest book <a href=#>Shootin’ the Sh*t with Kevin Smith</a>, he told the New York Post he had been down in the dumps over a creative slump, and smoking pot got him through it and helps his creativity. Of course he also admits he’s no longer a good director of his own work, which is why I say he’s not figuratively riding a creative high. But he encourages kids to smoke pot – after Seth Rogen encouraged him to. Now he says he lights up at least three times a day.</p><p>The king of stoner moviemakers, Kevin Smith, never really smoked much marijuana until Seth Rogen talked him into it last summer, he says. Now he sparks up at least three times a day and credits pot for helping him to dig his way out of a creative slump.</p><p>Not the sort of advice responsible parents, doctors or educators are likely to embrace, Smith told The Post’s Don Kaplan, “I know you’re supposed to tell kids not to do drugs, but, kids, do it! Do weed! Don’t do the other stuff, but weed is good . . . What you want to do is what I did, build a movie empire and, at age 38, smoke it all away.”</p><p>Smith is pushing his new book, “Shooting the S – – t With Kevin Smith,” a project he claims he didn’t even write because it’s a transcription of SModcast, his regular podcast with pal Scott Mosier. “I did so little work to put this book together, but I did everything to make the podcast happen, so by virtue of that I am the author,” he says.</p><p>Smith rode a wave of popularity in the early 1990s with movies like “Clerks” and “Chasing Amy.” He later stumbled with a string of bombs like “Jersey Girl,” and weed-centric “The Adventures of Bluntman and Chronic.” He then spent his down time agonizing over negative comments about his work on the Internet.</p><p>Now, thanks to a steady diet of marijuana, Smith says he’s moved on to greener pastures — writing a new “Batman” comic and directing films he didn’t write, including the upcoming cop buddy flick, “A Pair of Dicks,” with Bruce Willis and Tracy Morgan.</p><p>Smith says he’s “just not good” at directing his own stories anymore: “Judd Apatow is way better at being Kevin Smith now than Kevin Smith ever was. So Judd Apatow should do it for a while, and I should figure out something else, and weed has been [bleeping] helpful with that.”</p><p>[From the <a href=#>New York Post</a>]</p><p>“‘What you want to do is what I did, build a movie empire and, at age 38, smoke it all away.’” I love that. The last paragraph really bummed me out though. I’m not really a huge fan of his movies – I think you need to have a certain type of humor to appreciate them, and I just don’t have it. But I respect that he’s put out some great films that other people love. So hearing him talk about how he’s not good at doing what he used to be great at is a bit of a bummer. Especially saying that Judd Apatow is better at being him than he ever was.</p><p>Now Smith is going to have one hell of a time keeping his own daughter from smoking a ton of pot. Though he strikes me as likely being one of those parents that would light up with their kid. It seems to me like most people smoke pot mostly when they’re younger, and then taper off to a bit here and there. It’s funny that Kevin Smith has done the opposite. Whatever works for you I guess. Though something tells me he won’t be getting invites to speak at schools anytime soon.</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.picapp.com/ftp/Images/3/9/7/5/Kevin_Smith_Promotes_3ac9.jpg width=500 height=380 border=0 alt='Kevin Smith Promotes "Shooting The Sh*t With Kevin Smith"' style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.picapp.com/ftp/Images/e/a/c/1/Kevin_Smith_Promotes_67a1.jpg width=411 height=594 border=0 alt='Kevin Smith Promotes "Shooting The Sh*t With Kevin Smith"' style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.picapp.com/ftp/Images/0/d/8/7/Kevin_Smith_Promotes_791e.jpg width=500 height=368 border=0 alt='Kevin Smith Promotes "Shooting The Sh*t With Kevin Smith"' style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZmcGtoZYFwt8SvoKeXo6K2tbS%2Bnq%2Btp5yhwKDAx56Wo6epqKywsr6ppq2Xo6K8rLXNoGY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jerry-lee-lewis-height-how-tall-was-jerry-lee-lewis.html><span>←</span><span>Jerry Lee Lewis height: How tall was Jerry Lee Lewis?</span></a>
