That player turned out to be Utah Jazz's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rudy Gobert</a>. And now, Gobert is contributing to multiple relief funds as people continue to fight against the global pandemic.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The Jazz announced Gobert is donating $500,000 to support the employee relief fund at Vivint Smart Home Arena (home of the Utah Jazz) and coronavirus-related social services relief in Utah, Oklahoma City, and the health care system in France.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Since the NBA suspended its season, Gobert's teammate <a href=# title="Donovan Mitchell Net Worth">Donovan Mitchell</a> tested positive. Detroit's Christian Wood also tested positive; the Pistons played the Jazz on March 7.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>In a statement, Gobert shared why he's donating:</span></p><p><strong>"I am humbled by the tireless efforts and care of people around the globe for those affected by COVID-19, especially my own communities of Utah and France, in addition to my appreciation for the state of Oklahoma and my care there, and of course, my Utah Jazz family."</strong></p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-295417 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/GettyImages-1184509810.jpg alt width=900 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-295417 class=wp-caption-text>Christian Petersen/Getty Images</p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Gobert added the donations are the "first of many steps" he'll take to make a positive difference against COVID-19. That includes learning more about the virus and aiming to educate others.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Two days before his positive test, Gobert had jokingly touched every media microphone before leaving a post-game press conference. Jazz players also reported Gobert had a casual attitude in the locker room, continuing to make contact with other players. Gobert later apologized for his actions.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The money will be divided four ways: $200,000 will go to part-time employees at the Jazz's arena, with $100,000 each going to affected families in Utah and Oklahoma City. Finally, Gobert, who is French, is donating €100,000 to France's health care system.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The NBA suspended activities for at least 30 days. The teams that recently played the Jazz, including the Cleveland Cavaliers and Boston Celtics, are continuing to self-isolate. The Toronto Raptors, the team that most recently played in Salt Lake City, have tested their entire travel party. All of those tests came back negative.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>For his part, it looks like Gobert is trying to make amends for his actions. In an apology shared on Instagram, he said he hopes his story "serves as a warning and causes everyone to take this seriously."</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcL%2FPqKmtq12jsri%2FjpqdrZ2iYsGmv9OipaBloKTAqsDIr5xmnp%2BneqS70ailmq6Zp8K0edGum7Jll6Svpr7TZpuoppGpsqV5lGlnaWhgYsGwecSmp6WnqZqybq3NnWSsp5Oerq150p6pr6GTmsBuvsSloJ6eXZvCr7DSaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./trevor-francis-dead-how-did-trevor-francis-die.html><span>←</span><span>Trevor Francis Dead: How Did Trevor Francis Die?</span></a>
