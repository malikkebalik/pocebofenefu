Recommended Videos Granted, that episode’s trailer dropped when the show was going on a month long hiatus and it is not uncommon for those of that variety to tease multiple upcoming episodes, but considering that we are being offered the same Amara tease, we can only hope there is some kind of payoff next week."><meta name=author content="Reinaldo Massengill"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

While these creatures do not recur as much as vampires seem to on the show, I’m usually pleasantly surprised to see how the folks in the writers room find a way to not only put a new spin on the situation, but work in some way to make it relevant to whatever the Winchester boys are going through at the moment.</p><p data-characters=432 data-current-count=432 data-injectable=true>This time around, it seems like the producers are giving a bit of a nod to the classic film,&nbsp;Night of the Living Dead, only this time we are dealing with lycanthropes storming a house as opposed to zombies. Although Sam finds himself wounded in the episode, it’s a solid bet he’s still making it out alive – no matter what that reaper in the trailer says. I can’t, however, say the same for any guest stars.</p><p data-characters=67 data-current-count=67 data-injectable=false>For more details, be sure to check out the official synopsis below:</p><p>Sam (Jared Padalecki) and Dean (Jensen Ackles) battle a pair of werewolves who have captured two victims. Just as the brothers are about to win, one of the werewolves shoots Sam. Dean gets his brother and the victims out of the house but learns a pack of werewolves are hot on their tail, hoping to kill them all. Nina Lopez-Corrado directed the episode written by Robert Berens & Andrew Dabb (#1117).
