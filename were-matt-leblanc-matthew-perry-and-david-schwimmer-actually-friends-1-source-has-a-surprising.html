With their relationship on the rocks, Paul revealed that Matt thoroughly enjoyed <a href=#>his time on the set of Friends</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-6_14>He also noted that it was a transformative experience for him and the team.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-1><p></p></figure><p id=par-7_19>“He had fun, that’s for sure,” Paul stated. “It was the making of him and the entire crew, really.”</p><p id=par-8_26>In an eye-opening tidbit, Paul suggested that Matt had intimate moments with his co-star Jennifer Aniston in their private dressing areas while on breaks from shooting.</p><p id=par-9_19>According to Paul, these rendezvous occurred during Aniston’s marriage to Brad Pitt. However, Aniston has emphatically debunked such claims.</p><p id=par-10_11>And that’s not the only Friends relationship Paul had thoughts on.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Paul LeBlanc explains which cast members of ‘Friends’ were actually friends</h2><p id=par-11_13>Paul elaborated on his son Matt’s relationships with fellow actors Matthew and David.</p><p id=par-12_30>Matthew and Matt were powerhouse names on the small screen in their heyday. They were most recognized for their roles as bosom buddies <a href=#>Chandler Bing and Joey Tribbiani</a> on Friends.</p><p id=par-13_31>However, Paul conveyed that Matt wasn’t particularly fond of Matthew off-screen. According to Paul, Matt considered his co-star Matthew quite unlikeable and had moments where he wanted to confront him physically.</p><p id=par-14_12>“He wanted to pound on Matthew a couple of times,” Paul claimed.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-15_24>Regarding David, Paul mentioned that Matt found him overly solemn and not as lively. David’s personality contrasted with Lisa Kudrow, whom Matt genuinely appreciated.</p><p id=par-16_17>Despite this, Paul argued that the existing tension among the cast makes a Friends reboot highly improbable.</p><p id=par-17_25>A spokesperson for Matt LeBlanc has vehemently refuted all allegations made by his father. So fans should take his comments with a grain of salt.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-matt-leblanc-reveals-the-true-nature-of-his-relationship-with-matthew-perry-and-david-schwimmer>Matt LeBlanc reveals the true nature of his relationship with Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer</h2><p id=par-18_15>Contrary to Paul’s claims, evidence suggests Matt enjoyed amicable relations with all <a href=#>his Friends co-stars</a>.</p><p id=par-19_23>While Paul presents a different picture, it seems that Matt and Matthew have maintained their friendship even years after their time on Friends.</p><p id=par-20_16>Matt told <a href=#>People</a> in 2015 that he views the Friends cast much like an extended family.</p><p id=par-21_32>“Courteney [Cox] and Lisa [Kudrow] are like my big sisters, but [<a href=#>Jennifer Aniston</a> is] like my little sister,” Matt shared. “Matthew’s like my little brother, and David [Schwimmer]’s like my big brother.”&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-22_24>It’s worth noting that Schwimmer, Cox, and Kudrow are all older than Matt by a few years, whereas Aniston and Perry are slightly younger.</p><p id=par-23_35>In 2016, Matt spoke warmly about Perry, mentioning they could reconnect seamlessly even after years apart. He praised the enduring nature of their friendship, stating he’s still in frequent contact with all his Friends co-stars.</p><p id=par-24_27>Despite this camaraderie, it’s interesting that Matt, Matthew, and possibly David were the only Friends actors not to receive invitations to<a href=#> Aniston’s 2015 wedding to Justin Theroux</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTEpr7EZqSarKRiuaauy5qlnGWdlsG1tMSwZKmdoqfGbrDAr6CdZaOYtbi1zKacq2WRmMG2rculsGaeop6yr7DSZ5%2BtpZxk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jake-paul-paid-16-million-for-retired-baseball-player-s-mansion-in-puerto-rico.html><span>←</span><span>Jake Paul Paid $16 Million For Retired Baseball Player's Mansion In Puerto Rico</span></a>
