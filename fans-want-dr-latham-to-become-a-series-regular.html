He is also an Orthodox Jew who, according to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Chicago Med Wiki</a>, has Asperger syndrome. The condition “impairs his social abilities and empathy towards others.”</p><p id=par-5_40>Essandoh, who played astronaut Kwesi in the Netflix film&nbsp;Away&nbsp;with&nbsp;<a href=#>Hilary Swank</a>, enjoys playing the role of the complicated&nbsp;Chicago Med&nbsp;physician. The talented actor has appeared in films such as&nbsp;<a href=#>Django Unchained</a>and&nbsp;Jason Bourne.&nbsp;His resume also includes recurring roles on television series such as&nbsp;Blue Bloods&nbsp;and&nbsp;Elementary.</p><p id=par-6_49><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">FanSided</a>&nbsp;explains that “Latham is&nbsp;Chicago Med’s&nbsp;most enigmatic character. In one episode, he can be a complete jerk; in another, he’s surprisingly sympathetic.” His closest friend in the hospital was fellow physician Dr. Connor Rhodes (<a href=#>Colin Donnell</a>). While they had a love-hate relationship, they always seemed to have each other’s backs.</p><p id=par-7_37>Offscreen, Essandoh and Donnell shared an undeniable “bromance” that transcended well to the scenes they often shared. Their chemistry was undeniable, despite their often contentious interactions. The actors constantly challenged one another, and fans loved the result.</p><h2 id=h-fans-want-to-see-more-of-dr-latham>Fans want to see more of Dr. Latham</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/chicago-med-1.jpg><p id=par-8_16>In a recent&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Reddit</a>&nbsp;forum, fans discussed the&nbsp;Chicago Med&nbsp;Season 6 finale titled “I Will Come to Save You.”</p><p id=par-9_31>Fans agreed that Dr. Latham needs much more screen time. Many are hoping the departure of Natalie (<a href=#>Torrey DeVitto</a>) and April (Yaya DaCosta) will make more room for his complex character.</p><p id=par-10_41>Viewers are&nbsp;<a href=#>hoping writers will make better use</a>&nbsp;of his character, allowing Essandoh to stretch his range and further develop Dr. Latham’s relationships with other physicians in the hospital. Making him a series regular would make a lot of loyal fans very happy.</p><h2 id=h-chicago-med-will-dr-latham-become-a-series-regular>‘Chicago Med’: Will Dr. Latham become a series regular?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-11_26>The chances of him being promoted to a series regular are pretty slim, considering Dr. Latham has only appeared in 32 episodes throughout the entire season.</p><p id=par-12_55>The surgeon specializes in cardiothoracic surgery. He is only called into the ER when the storyline involves a cardiac patient. Dr. Latham also shared numerous scenes with Dr. Rhodes, who is no longer with the show. Whether one of the new characters develops a story arc with the talented surgeon is yet to be seen.</p><p id=par-13_71><a href=#>Season 7</a>&nbsp;will introduce Kristen Hager as Dr. Stevie Hammer and Guy Lockard as Dr. Dylan Scott, a former police officer.&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">FanSided</a>&nbsp;pointed out that Lockard is not a stranger to the franchise, appearing in Season 8, Episode 19 of&nbsp;Chicago Fire.&nbsp;In the “Light Things Up” episode, Lockard played a “frustrated father who chained himself to 51’s engines.” The character was trying to catch the attention of the CFD higher-ups in hopes of creating change.</p><p id=par-14_49>It is unclear if that connection will cross over into the storyline with the new arrival of Dr. Scott to the Gaffney Emergency Room. With lots of changes on the horizon, fans may get their wish of seeing more of Dr. Latham in the upcoming season of Chicago Med.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSwqbXCmp6oZZ2asW6ywKeqZq%2BRo8FusNFmo5qsmJa6bq7EnKamnV2osrO1xKxkq52Xqrmivo2hq6akXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./does-the-filipino-actor-have-one.html><span>←</span><span>Does The Filipino Actor Have One?</span></a>
