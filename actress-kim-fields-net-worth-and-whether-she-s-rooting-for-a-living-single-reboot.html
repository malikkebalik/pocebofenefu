The film was a The Facts of Life reunion of sorts, as it featured the 51-year-old’s costars from the 1980s comedy, including Lisa Whelchel, Nancy McKeon, and Mindy Cohn.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-2>Lisa Whelchel, Kim Fields, and Mindy Cohn on the set of ‘You Light Up My Christmas’</figure><p id=par-6_49>She told <a href=#>Extra</a> in 2019, &nbsp;“The movie has the wonderful ice skating rink in the storyline and I thought, ‘Wouldn’t it be cool if my “Facts of Life” sisters were these characters that ran the skating rink, and we named the ice skating rink Charlotte for Charlotte Rae?’ “</p><p id=par-7_15>Rae, who played the girls’ headmistress, Mrs. Garrett, on the classic show, died in 2018.</p><p id=par-8_39>All the actresses agreed to appear in the film, but at the last moment, McKeon had a family emergency. Even so, that didn’t stop her from keeping her promise to make it a true The Facts of Life reunion.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-9_58>“Nancy McKeon had a really difficult, unexpected family emergency she had to work through,” she said, “and she still stayed committed, and said, ‘I will still do the part — I can’t come to Vancouver and film with you guys, but I will do my part and you can put it in there.’ We’re still on screen together.”</p><p id=par-10_30>Fields was moved by her friend’s gesture, saying, “It was one of the hardest things that she ever had to go through, [and] she still put it down for me.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What Fields has been up to lately</h2><p id=par-11_36>The mother of two has been making a name for herself as an in-demand director, having directed dozens of episodes of Tyler Perry’s House of Payne,&nbsp;as well as episodes of shows like&nbsp;Kenan & Kel&nbsp;and&nbsp;Let’s Stay Together.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-4></figure><p id=par-12_38>She also <a href=#>directed in 2018 an episode</a> of HBO’s Insecure in its third season, “Kev’yn,” which playfully poked fun at Living Single. She said on Instagram at the time, “SO much fun directing “Insecure” Season 3&nbsp;#ShowInAShow&nbsp;90s comedy “Kev’yn”!”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Fields’ net worth and whether she sees a ‘Living Single’ reboot in the future</h2><p id=par-13_20>Speaking of the iconic 1990s sitcom, Fields finally revealed whether she thinks a reboot of the beloved series will happen.</p><p id=par-14_27>“Well, never say never,” she told <a href=#>blackgirlnerds</a> in 2019. “[P]eople have to&nbsp;be careful with [reboots], I think, because to have hit anything has a bit of lightning-in-a-bottle-element.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-5></figure><p id=par-15_28>The actress, who has a <a href=#>net worth of $8 million</a>, explained her hesitance in pursuing a reboot of the show, as great as the clamor is for it.</p><p id=par-16_79>“You want to make sure you recognize and have the reference for that lightning that was captured. The process of capturing lightning in a bottle — it’s not just a case of let’s build a barn and put on a show. You can’t just go, ‘Where are these characters now?’ If you don’t get that right, your fans will turn on you in a heartbeat because these are characters that they love, that they resonate with, that they recognize.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSupMDRnqqsZZueum6yyJ6jnatdo7K1edaoqa2gXZa7pXnWoZytoJWnerS0xKxkq6efqbavs4yfpqtlkWK5qsLIp55mq5mjtK2xjKucm6efqXupwMylZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./12-most-expensive-houses-owned-by-famous-footballers-then-and-now.html><span>←</span><span>12 Most Expensive Houses Owned by Famous Footballers (Then and Now)</span></a>
