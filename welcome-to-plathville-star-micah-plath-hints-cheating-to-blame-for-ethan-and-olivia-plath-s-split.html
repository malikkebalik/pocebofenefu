Both came from ultra-conservative religious backgrounds, but Olivia soon began to question the lifestyle in which she was raised. That led to <a href=#>increasing conflict with Ethan’s parents</a>, Barry and Kim Plath, and later, with his siblings Micah and Moriah Plath. The intra-family tension was often highlighted on Welcome to Plathville, which premiered in 2019 and followed Ethan, Olivia, and other members of the Plath family.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-10_29>On Oct. 27, Ethan and Olivia announced their separation in a pair of Instagram posts. The breakup appeared amicable, with both saying they wished the best for the other.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-11_38>In his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">post</a>, Ethan said that he and his wife realized that they had “different goals” and were “pulling each other in opposite directions in life.” He also said they both gave “all we had” to the marriage.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-olivia-said-she-was-too-young-to-get-married>Olivia said she was too young to get married&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Ethaan-Plath-Olivia-Plath-Welcome-to-Plathville-Season-5.png><p id=par-12_23>In her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">post</a>, Olivia hinted that she and Ethan got married too young.
