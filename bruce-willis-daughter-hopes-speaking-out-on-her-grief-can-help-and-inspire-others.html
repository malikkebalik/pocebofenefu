I think that for me, I hope that whatever anyone needed to take from that, they can take from it. I don’t necessarily want to dictate what they needed to take from that. I think that that’s their truth, and I just hope that there can be more moments that I can help open up the space for things to resonate for people.”</p><p data-characters=557 data-current-count=557 data-injectable=true>In her essay, Tallulah reflects on her response to her father’s health challenges, acknowledging that she initially coped with “avoidance and denial.” At the time, she was already grappling with several daunting diagnoses: substance dependency, anorexia nervosa, and ADHD. Her family intervened after her engagement came to a painful end, with Tallulah checking into a mental health facility and received a new diagnosis; borderline personality disorder. There, she took the transformative first steps on her path to healing, as she wrote.</p><p>“Recovery is probably lifelong, but I now have the tools to be present in all facets of my life, and especially in my relationship with my dad. I can bring him an energy that’s bright and sunny, no matter where I’ve been.”</p><p data-characters=328 data-current-count=569 data-injectable=true>Tallulah Belle Willis is the third of her father’s five daughters.
