The couple, both now 31, met when Loren—a New Yorker who now lives with Alexei in Florida—went on a Birthright tour to Israel. Alexei was her tour group’s medic, and the pair quickly hit it off and fell in love.</p><p id=par-2_38><a href=#>Alexei and Loren</a> didn’t have many major conflicts on the road to love. But one sore spot for the happy couple was Loren’s diagnosis of Tourette’s syndrome, which she revealed on the show after fans bullied her for her symptoms.</p><p id=par-3_66>While <a href=#>Alexei was supportive</a> of his wife—who has since served as an ambassador for Tourette’s advocacy groups—he was concerned about the possibility of their future kids developing the syndrome. Loren was hurt by some of her then-fiancé’s comments about her diagnosis, but they reconciled and happily began to plan their future family. Loren recently gave birth to the couple’s first child, a baby boy they named <a href=#>Shai Josef</a>, in mid-April 2020.</p><p id=par-4_49>On a recent episode of <a href=#>TLC GO</a>’s 90 Day Fiancé: What Now, Alexei and Loren visited a doctor to discuss their growing baby’s genetic testing results. They asked the physician about what to look for in terms of the potential of their little one showing signs of Tourette’s syndrome.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/LorenBrovarnik.png><h2>Loren and Alexei asked their doctor about the possibility of their child developing Tourette’s syndrome</h2><p id=par-5_41>On <a href=#>90 Day Fiancé: What Now</a>, Alexei accompanied Loren to an ob/gyn appointment to discuss their baby’s health and have an ultrasound. The physician told the parents-to-be that their baby was in the 43rd percentile and seemed to be growing at a typical rate.</p><p id=par-6_21>The couple anxiously asked about their test results from a recent battery of testing at the 20-week mark of Loren’s pregnancy.</p><p id=par-7_21>“We submitted some genetic testing, to make sure all the chromosomes are there,” Alexei told TLC producers. “I’m nervous,” Loren added.</p><p id=par-8_29>But the <a href=#>90 Day Fiancé pair</a> got good news. “The test for neurological problems, for Down syndrome and for the chromosomes of the baby, everything was normal,” their doctor told them.</p><p id=par-9_34>Loren also brought up her own diagnosis of Tourette’s. “So, you know I have Tourette’s syndrome,” she ventured anxiously. “Is there a way to find out now? Is there genetic testing?” she wanted to know.</p><p id=par-10_47>The physician informed her that she wouldn’t be able to find out about the potential for Tourette’s syndrome during her pregnancy. “No, there is no genetic testing for Tourette’s syndrome,” he explained. “The first symptoms you can see are around between three to nine years old.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-2></figure><h2>The couple said they’d cross that bridge when they came to it, if necessary</h2><p id=par-11_29>Despite Loren’s earlier anxieties and self-consciousness about Tourette’s syndrome, the expectant mom seemed much more at peace with and confident about her baby’s future. “We’ll wait and see,” she said.</p><p id=par-12_35>Alexei, too, seemed to have evolved on the subject, appearing calmer on the topic than he had in the couple’s earlier appearances on the show. “We’re not going to stress about it too much,” he agreed.</p><p id=par-13_47>As for Loren, she didn’t want to dwell on worries that might not ever come to fruition. “I don’t want to worry about something that’s nothing right now,” the <a href=#>90 Day Fiancé star</a> explained. “The baby could have it when he or she is older, and we just have to wait.”</p><p id=par-14_23>Alexei agreed with his wife, suggesting that they’d cross that bridge when they came to it. “We’ll deal with it then,” he said.</p><p id=par-15_31>For now, <a href=#>the Brovarniks</a> just wanted to enjoy the pregnancy and stay excited for their new arrival. “We’ve got a very, very strong and healthy baby, thank God,” Loren gushed.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-3></figure><h2>The Brovarniks’ little boy was born healthy and adorable</h2><p id=par-16_53>The Brovarniks recently brought home their little bundle of joy. Shai—which means “gift” in Hebrew—was born a little early, arriving on April 14 instead of May as they’d originally expected. He recently turned a month old, according to <a href=#>In Touch Weekly</a>. Loren and Alexei have been over-the-moon about sharing pictures of their adorable newborn son on <a href=#>Instagram</a>.</p><p id=par-17_46>Still, like many 90 Day Fiancé cast members, <a href=#>Loren and Alexei</a> haven’t been free from bullying on social media—even about their sweet baby boy. Loren recently took to her Instagram stories to reveal a cruel and heartless direct message she received from a viewer, as reported by <a href=#>The Blast</a>.</p><p id=par-18_20>“Ugly baby that will have Tourette’s because the parents are selfish a**holes that should have adopted,” the bullying message read.</p><p id=par-19_57>Loren, of course, jumped to her son’s defense immediately, putting the critic in their place. “It’s one thing to TRY and bring me down (inserts chuckles)…but bring my son into this—you’re messing with the WRONG mama bear!” the 90 Day Fiancé star wrote in response. “Troll or not, get a f***ing life! And get some water because you’re thirsty as hell!”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSGcXnDmrBmnpmWu6SxjKWmq52eYq6vsIyao56wlZ56o77Or5irppmgeqW10pysrKtdqbWmtdFmnZ6dnJ67qL%2BMqKVmrJiatrN5wZqZsmWgpMGmutOimKWkqWKxpsLEpaapoZ6cerW71KucrayVqHq0xc2dqaillWK5sL7Ep2SsoKWpwG6wzrClZpldqb%2BwuMtmrqGnXZ67tMHLrapmoJWneq%2Bx1pumq6ZdqLyvesetpKVn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./chris-hemsworth-is-a-foot-taller-than-elsa-pataky-but-7-years-younger.html><span>←</span><span>Chris Hemsworth Is a Foot Taller Than Elsa Pataky but 7 Years Younger</span></a>
