So, here are ten movie characters that you’d raise an eyebrow at if you were introduced to them at a party:</p><h2 id=h-spurgeon-fish-tanner-deep-impact data-injectable=false>Spurgeon “Fish” Tanner (Deep Impact)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/proxy.jpg><p data-characters=357 data-current-count=357 data-injectable=false>In Deep Impact, Robert Duvall’s Spurgeon “Fish” Tanner is the former astronaut chosen to pilot the ship assigned to destroy the comet threatening Earth. I’ve never met a Spurgeon and you probably haven’t either, as even at the height of its popularity among parents in 1895, only a few hundred baby Spurgeons were ever spawned.</p><p data-characters=178 data-current-count=535 data-injectable=true>That said, there’s one semi-notable modern Spurgeon, one of reality stars Ben Seward and Jessa Duggar’s children from 19 Kids and Counting bears this strange moniker.</p><h2 id=h-stacker-pentecost-pacific-rim data-injectable=false>Stacker Pentecost (Pacific Rim)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/unnamed-17.jpg><p data-characters=362 data-current-count=662 data-injectable=true>When Mommy and Daddy Pentecost were naming their new kid, they went hard. Pacific Rim‘s Stacker Pentecost may have a truly stupid name, but it somehow fits in this crazy world of interdimensional kaiju and giant jet-powered dual-piloted robots. Idris Elba promptly delivers a scenery-chewing performance worthy of this barnstorming, but deeply silly, name.</p><h2 id=h-beatrix-kiddo-kill-bill-vols-1-2 data-injectable=false>Beatrix Kiddo (Kill Bill Vols 1 & 2)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/uma-thurman-kill-bill-e1674459863684.jpg><p data-characters=484 data-current-count=784 data-injectable=true>Let’s say there’s probably a good reason Uma Thurman’s badass assassin in the Kill Bill movies prefers to go by “The Bride” and that her name is bleeped out in Vol. 1. Legend has it Thurman and Quentin Tarantino named the character together, with Thurman opting for “Beatrix” and Tarantino choosing “Kiddo” because “that’s what I call women — when I really like a girl, I call her kiddo”. Uh, sure Quentin.</p><h2 id=h-nymphadora-tonks-harry-potter-series data-injectable=false>Nymphadora Tonks (Harry Potter series)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/tonks-harry-potter.png><p data-characters=298 data-current-count=598 data-injectable=true>Sorry, Potter fans, but Nymphadora Tonks is particularly silly even among the many odd names strewn across the Wizarding World. Even the character herself seems to be embarrassed by her first name, preferring to go simply by Tonks – which itself is kinda dumb, but not as dumb as Nymphadora.</p><h2 id=h-pistachio-disguisey-the-master-of-disguise data-injectable=false>Pistachio Disguisey (The Master of Disguise)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/the-master-of-disguise.jpg><p data-characters=471 data-current-count=771 data-injectable=true>Okay look, I know The Master of Disguise is a goofy comedy movie and I’ve tried to exclude names from this list that are purposefully silly. But Pistachio Disguisey? Really? C’mon Dana Carvey. Perhaps it’s for the best that this movie (which sits at <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">an impressive 1% on the Tomatometer</a>) is now primarily known for holding a moment of silent respect for the victims of 9/11 while Carvey was dressed in a giant green ‘turtle suit’ (see above).</p><h2 id=h-jericho-cane-end-of-days data-injectable=false>Jericho Cane (End of Days)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/end-of-days-1.jpg><p data-characters=429 data-current-count=729 data-injectable=true>Hmm, we need a name for Arnie in our ill-conceived biblical action/horror movie. How about Jericho Cain? No, no that’s too obvious, let’s go with Jericho Cane. Arnie has played some very stupidly named characters over the years (John Matrix, Harry Tasker, Dutch Schaefer, Victor Fries, etc) but for sheer ‘bludgeon you over the head with the movie’s themes’ Jericho Cane is by far the top candidate.</p><h2 id=h-flipper-purify-jungle-fever data-injectable=false>Flipper Purify (Jungle Fever)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Annabella-Sciorra-Wesley-Snipes-in-Jungle-Fever-Universal-04-A-BFI-Blu-ray-release-scaled-scaled-1.jpg><p data-characters=397 data-current-count=697 data-injectable=true>Flipper… Purify? That’s not a name, Spike Lee! Those are just random words! Lee’s 1991 movie Jungle Fever sees Wesley Snipes play Flipper, a successful architect. It’s an excellent movie and also boasts a career-making performance from Samuel L. Jackson as Flipper’s brother named… wait for it… Gator Purify. What on earth were Mr and Mrs Purify thinking?</p><h2 id=h-dr-christmas-jones-the-world-is-not-enough data-injectable=false>Dr. Christmas Jones (The World is Not Enough)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/q-OVO7CyeUnRmk6ctsLKocv5YQGw9sLGl-4w7pr1m8nKr29eDykIClIOCc5gNcLQk1cAdPCKYWTZTIrVp0aGipxvz0XUA0k4BRlzfdv3Ma4.jpg><p data-characters=389 data-current-count=689 data-injectable=true>I one hundred percent guarantee the only reason Denise Richards’ somewhat unlikely nuclear scientist in James Bond movie The World is Not Enough is named Christmas Jones is so he can deliver the smarmy line “I thought Christmas only comes once a year” just before the credits roll. When you’re naming characters entirely for one awful joke, you’ve screwed up.</p><h2 id=h-hale-caesar-the-expendables-series data-injectable=false>Hale Caesar (The Expendables series)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/unnamed-19.jpg><p data-characters=448 data-current-count=748 data-injectable=true>The Expendables franchise is littered with awful names. The worst has to be Donnie Yen’s “martial arts specialist” character Yin Yang (… eesh), the most head-scratching is Randy Couture’s demolition expert Toll Road (??), but the dumbest is Terry Crews’ heavy weapons guy Hale Caesar. I guess with a name like that you have two options: blowing away enemies with a giant shotgun or porn. Hale picked the shotgun.</p><h2 id=h-johnny-goodboy-battlefield-earth data-injectable=false>Johnny Goodboy (Battlefield Earth)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/unnamed-20.jpg><p data-characters=488 data-current-count=788 data-injectable=false>Far be it from us to criticize the literary talents of Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard, though perhaps calling the hero of your post-apocalyptic saga Johnny Goodboy is just a little on the nose. Barry Pepper would get the unfortunate job of playing Goodboy in the famously dreadful 2000 movie adaptation, which Roger Ebert compared to “taking a bus trip with someone who has needed a bath for a long time. It’s not merely bad; it’s unpleasant in a hostile way.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJoq6GdXamyr3nDrqSbnaOpeqS0wKuYnKyVp3qvrcyeqmahnmK6sMLInmShoaOpvLPFjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sean-lowe-biography-age-height-wife-net-worth-family.html><span>←</span><span>Sean Lowe Biography, Age, Height, Wife, Net Worth, Family</span></a>
