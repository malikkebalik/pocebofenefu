Sal Vulcano is best known for his involvement in the series "Impractical Jokers." As a member of the comedy troupe "The Tenderloins," Vulcano appears on the series and performs improvisational comedy in a hidden-camera-style format.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Salvatore Edward Anthony Vulcano was born on November 5th of 1976 on Staten Island in New York. During his high school years, Vulcano joined a number of sports teams and clubs, but he truly shone when it came to improvisational comedy. During high school, he also met the three future co-members of The Tenderloins, and together they joined the improv club. Even as a teen, Vulcano's comedic skills were plain to see.</p><p>After graduating from high school, Sal Vulcano attended St. John's University. He eventually obtained a degree in Finance and set his sights on a career as an entrepreneur. However, he quickly reconnected with his old pals from high school after graduating from high school. In 1999, Sal Vulcano joined <a href=# title="James Murray Net Worth">James Murray</a>, <a href=# title="Brian Quinn Net Worth">Brian Quinn</a>, and Joe Gatto to become The Tenderloins for the first time.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-247984 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/GettyImages-480346698.jpg alt="Sal Vulcano" width=429 height=594 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-247984 class=wp-caption-text>Getty Images</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>The Tenderloins began their career by filming comedy sketches and posting them on YouTube, MySpace, and Metacafe. Their content quickly went viral, and in 2007 they gained notoriety after winning NBC's "It's Your Show" competition for their sketch short "Time Thugs." They continue to perform at live venues, and their YouTube channel is still active.</p><p>In 2011, Sal Vulcano and the rest of The Tenderloins had their breakthrough with "Impractical Jokers," a TV show that aired on truTV. In its first season, the show was watched by over 30 million people. As of 2020, "Impractical Jokers" is still going strong. Sal Vulcano has a reputation for being the "most punished" joker on the series.</p><p>In 2019, Sal and the rest of The Tenderloins appeared on the game show "The Misery Index." In 2020, Vulcano and the rest of his comedy troupe starred in "Impractical Jokers: The Movie." Vulcano has also participated in podcasts like "The Tenderloins Podcast" and "What Say You?"</p><p>After spending more than six months away from the stage due to the covid-19 pandemic, Sal announced plans to perform at a "drive-in show" in 2020. He expressed hope that he would still be able to satisfy audiences despite the long hiatus, also claiming that he had no choice since "rent was due."</p><p>In 2020, it was announced that truTV had launched a board game based on the "Impractical Jokers" series called "Impractical Jokers: Box of Challenges." Distributed by Wilder Games, the board game requires players to pull off "embarrassing challenges" on unsuspecting friends. It is unknown whether or not the cast of "Impractical Jokers" had any direct involvement in the development of the board game, or whether they earn a share of the profits.</p><h2 id=other-ventures><strong>Other Ventures</strong></h2><p>From 2010 to 2014, Vulcano was involved in the management of a bar in Staten Island called The Full Cup. The bar was well-known in the community as a comedy and music venue. However, the bar ran into a number of legal and financial issues over the years, and Vulcano ostensibly jumped ship when he saw signs of impending failure. In 2016, the bar closed down for good.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR7wJyrqKqjZMCiuNWaq6iqlWLDtrjCmqWoZZ6awW7DzquroWc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jonny-fairplay-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Jonny Fairplay Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</span></a>
