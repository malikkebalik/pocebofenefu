<a href=../../../../the-10-spookiest-supernatural-episodes-to-get-you-into-the-halloween-spirit.html></a>
Supernatural is one of the biggest paranormal TV series in recent history, having finished its run in 2020 after 15 seasons of non-stop horror. Most say it went on for way too long. For others, it was not even close to enough.
Recommended Videos Most of the show’s scariest episodes are from earlier seasons when Supernatural was in the habit of featuring some type of monster every week. Granted, a lot of those ended up being ghosts, but the series has a much wider variety of spooky entities, from vampires, djinn, demons, werewolves, and witches, to cursed objects, and even Satan himself.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>The Blacklist Season Premiere Review: Lord Baltimore (Season 2, Episode 1)</h2><time>Sep 29, 2024</time>

Recommended Videos And so the second season of The Blacklist begins. Did anyone else miss the phenomenon that is James Spader as Raymond “Red” Reddington?
Last season quickly became a fan-favorite, and if the premiere is any proof, Season 2 will surely have the same impact. So, let’s get to the nitty-gritty of the second season debut, “Lord Baltimore.”
Talk about an explosive premiere — and opening. You know it’s going to be a grand episode when ZZ Top’s La Grange is playing in the background as Red is bleeding, handcuffed and looking irritated laying on the floor of a Jeep, as he is being driven to make a deal with a Cameroon warlord.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Travis Ely Obituary And Autopsy Died In Unexpected Car Collision</h2><time>Sep 29, 2024</time>

<a href=../../../../first-look-promo-for-supernatural-season-11-episode-17-red-meat.html></a>
The CW has offered this first look at next week’s brand new episode of&nbsp;Supernatural, which is titled “Red Meat.” Oddly enough, it features the same narration as the trailer for the previous episode, “Safe House,” that speaks rather ominously of Amara/The Darkness.
Recommended Videos Granted, that episode’s trailer dropped when the show was going on a month long hiatus and it is not uncommon for those of that variety to tease multiple upcoming episodes, but considering that we are being offered the same Amara tease, we can only hope there is some kind of payoff next week.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Anxiety and Mood Swings</h2><time>Sep 27, 2024</time>
<a href=../../../../anxiety-and-mood-swings.html></a>
"Mood swings" has often been an incorrectly used term. People talk about those that are emotional as though they have mood swings when it truth their emotions are perfectly normal reactions to life events. Someone that cries often or someone that's angry isn't necessarily suffering from a "swing" simply because they have a strong emotion. They just have stronger emotions.
True mood swings occur when you can go from happy to sad in a moment, without anything apparently triggering it.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Ghostbusters 3 Set Photos Reveal The Return Of The Ecto-1</h2><time>Sep 27, 2024</time>
