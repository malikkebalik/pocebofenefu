Being able to answer this question is hard because not everyone watches SparkShorts.</p><p><strong>The dog in the American computer-animated short film “Out” is named “Jim.” </strong>Below you will get other information related to “Out”.</p><p><strong>You can also check out our below posts related to other characters:</strong></p><h2>What is the Story of “Out”?</h2><p><strong>In the story, a young gay man who hasn’t told his parents about his s*xual orientation experiences a sudden and miraculous mind-swap with his dog. </strong>Greg and his lover Manuel are packing up Greg’s things to relocate when a supernatural dog and cat arrive outside Greg’s townhouse.</p><p>The cat gives magic to Greg’s dog Jim’s collar. Inside, recalling a picture of them together, Manuel pushes Greg to tell his parents about his s*xual orientation and they rush to his aid without warning. Manuel slips out the back door and Greg quickly hides the photo.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Melissa-Peterman-Weight-Loss-5.jpg><p>With his hands on Jim’s collar, Greg mutters a wish to turn into a dog and their brains magically exchange bodies. While his calm father lights the grill, “Greg” runs outside to play in the yard. “Jim” is trying to get to him while also desperately trying to stop his mother from finding the picture.</p><p>She sits and talks out loud about how sad she is that her son is moving away while “Jim” listens. She is mad at the dog for acting up. If she could talk to Greg, she would tell him that she hopes he finds love and that “he makes you happy.”</p><p>“Jim” realizes all of a sudden that she knows and doesn’t mind that he is gay. He comforts her for a short time, then goes after “Greg” and changes their minds again. That night, Greg presents Manuel to his parents, and Greg’s dad gives Manuel a hug out of the blue.
