The new series represents something of a passing of the torch with the introduction of Hailee Steinfeld’s character, Kate Bishop.&nbsp;</p><p>Hawkeye follows Barton on his quest through New York City to reunite with his family in time for the holidays. Unfortunately for Barton, an old enemy from his past as Ronin stands in his way. To overcome the mysterious adversary, Barton enlists the help of Kate Bishop who, in the comics, eventually goes on to become the second Hawkeye.</p><p>While the nature of the series’ antagonists remains vague for now, the impending appearance of Kingpin’s adoptive daughter Maya Lopez, aka Echo, has fans speculating that it might have something to do with the Daredevil comics or even a return to the MCU for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Vincent D’Onofrio’s Kingpin</a>.</p><p>Hawkeye is set to begin streaming new episodes on Disney Plus on Nov. 24. In addition to <strong>Renner</strong> and Steinfeld, the series will also star Vera Farmiga and Florence Pugh.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yvsdZmp6GnpKR6tLTOqKtmr5mptW60wLCinrGVYq6kwM6rZKOdopq6unnRnqWnnaJitaK%2FjJ%2BYp6tdqbWqvtKtoKefXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./marsha-blackburn-wiki-age-biography-husband-family-parents-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Marsha Blackburn Wiki, Age, Biography, Husband, Family, Parents, Net Worth</span></a>
