A lot of media outlets were predicting last Friday that Kelly and Brandon Blackstock would finally get hitched this weekend, so I’m glad they went through with it. Even better than just announcing their marriage, Kelly tweeted three beautiful photos from her Tennessee wedding, complete with some great angles on her lovely Temperley wedding gown. I approve! Seriously. I love when brides are like “here are some free photos of my wedding dress, go ahead and talk about how great I looked.” And Kelly did look really good, right? I love Temperley wedding gowns. There’s feminine, sweet, romantic and yet they are very rarely cloying or cutesy. Alice Temperley is really good at finding that balance. Here’s more about the wedding:</p><p>She’s married, y’all! Kelly Clarkson has finally tied the knot with her fiance Brandon Blackstock. The “Catch My Breath” singer said “I do” in Tennessee on Sunday, Oct. 20.</p><p>“I’m officially Mrs. Blackstock,” Clarkson, 31, tweeted Monday, Oct. 21 with three gorgeous photos from the wedding. “We got married yesterday at Blackberry Farms in TN, the most beautiful place ever!”</p><p>The blushing bride wore a Temperly London wedding gown for her special day. She shared one sweet photo of her groom giving her a kiss on the cheek while standing on a bridge. In another shot, the newlyweds share a passionate kiss while posing in a stunning field. “Thnx Temperley 4 my beautiful dress!” Clarkson also captioned a third photo of her gown. “And thank you to my friend @JimVerraros & Maria Elena 4 the beautiful headpiece!”</p><p>Clarkson is currently getting her pilot’s license; she actually flew the couple in for the ceremony and talent manager Blackstock, 36, was going to fly them back out, a source told Us Weekly.</p><p>“We have to fit our romantic life into our schedule,” Clarkson exclusively told Us about the upcoming nuptials at the Green Mountain Coffee “Great Coffee, Good Vibes, Choose fair Trade” campaign concert in NYC on Oct. 10. “It’ll be both a wedding and an elopement. I like it! We are just doing a small, little wedding — me and Brandon and the kids. That is it. All we have time for! But we’re happy with that.” She continued: “We just wanted to make it about us.”</p><p>Clarkson is set to film a Christmas special at the end of the month, and wanted to wed before then. “We are trying to squeeze in the wedding before that. Like I said, just running off and doing it,” she explained to Us.</p><p>The newlyweds first revealed they were engaged in December 2012. “I’m engaged!” the Season 1 American Idol winner wrote via Twitter. “I wanted y’all to know! Happiest night of my life last night! I am so lucky and am with the greatest man ever.” Alongside the comment, the rocker also showed off her stunning yellow canary Johnathon Arndt diamond ring.</p><p>Clarkson’s small ceremony is no surprise, as the “Stronger” singer revealed in August that the couple were thinking of eloping in lieu of an extravagant wedding. At the time, the decision to marry quick led to some speculation that she was pregnant. “FYI…Brandon & I are getting married & no I am not pregnant,” the Grammy winner replied back via Twitter.</p><p>She added: “We are eloping for one reason only. We both want an intimate ceremony.”</p><p>This is the first marriage for Clarkson. Blackstock, who is the stepson of country singer Reba McEntire, has two children from a previous marriage — daughter Savannah, 12, and son Seth, 6. The couple and his two children already live under the same roof, but the “People Like Us” singer is hoping to expand. She laughed, “I want two kids. Two more, that is. I’ve already got two!”</p><p><a href=#>[From Us Weekly]</a></p><p>I don’t think she’s pregnant. Yet. I bet she gets knocked up quickly though. Ten bucks says Kelly gets knocked up before Blake Lively. Any takers on that wager? And holy $^*#, her 36-year-old husband already has a tween daughter and a 6-year-old son? Wow. Well, I hope everything works out. Happy thoughts for Kelly and Brandon, and congrats to them on their lovely wedding.</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/kelly3.jpg alt=kelly3 width=522 sizes="(max-width: 682px) 100vw, 682px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/kelly2.jpg alt=kelly2 width=542 sizes="(max-width: 682px) 100vw, 682px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Photos courtesy of <a href=#>Kelly Clarkson’s Twitter</a>.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZmbGtgZYV5e8qeo6Wxj5i5or7KrKanl6ekv6ar056kqZ2iobK6q8uopZ2nnpSzsL6%2BoZyrl6OkwrW0xKulmK%2BVmbGqusaYnqiql5q8tr%2B%2BoKawpl8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./is-he-dating-carla-humphries.html><span>←</span><span>Is He Dating Carla Humphries?</span></a>
