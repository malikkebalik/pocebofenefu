One of his most prized possessions is the ball that represented <a href=#>Mark McGwire's</a> record 70th single-season home run – even though market forces have determined that it's a lot less prized than it used to be.</p><p>How much less?

McFarlane reportedly paid $500,000 for Barry's #73 home run ball.</p><p>Of course, while few expect McFarlane ever to get a return on his $3 million investment, the value of the ball could climb if the ESPN documentary draws collector interest towards items relating to that 1998 home run chase, which is exactly what happened with <a href=#>Michael Jordan</a> and Chicago Bulls collectibles after the release of&nbsp;The Last Dance. But McFarlane is doing OK financially in any case, and is set to make his feature film directorial debut with an upcoming new&nbsp;Spawn&nbsp;movie, so he's probably not losing too much sleep over the monetary value of his baseball collection.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcK%2FEpZybqpmpxnDAzp2bZqWTm66zuMCnnKxlY2K6qrjLoqanZZ2Wv6x5zJyesKGimnp4fNOhZKGnnZp6s8HNZpmapJxitaK%2FjJ2pqKigmrFuv8igpaKemZiur8DLsmSipl2rrq3BxGg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./pictures-of-travis-scott-s-head-tattoo-might-make-you-actually-like-the-ink.html><span>←</span><span>Pictures Of Travis Scott's Head Tattoo Might Make You Actually Like The Ink</span></a>
