Celebrity</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Footage of Anuel sitting in the chair of a tattoo artist was recently posted on Instagram with the rapper sharing a cheesy grin as he gets some of his ink reworked. The post includes a comment that says Anuel is planning on covering the tattoo on his back that features him and Karol. Add a comment Instagram</p><p>Anuel AA’s back tattoo isn’t the only one that will remind him of his ex. Unless he’s already had them covered up, he also has Karol G’s birthname “Carolina” tattooed on his body in two places – on his left hand and on his right wrist. With all that ink, we’re not sure where the name “Yailin” is going to fit.</p><p>Although the Puerto Rican is writing a new story with the 20-year-old singer, there are some details that he still maintains about his ex-partner. During his relationship with Karol G, Anuel got two tattoos that excited the Colombian at the time. One of them is his first name, Carolina, which is located on your left hand.</p><p>As seen in this makeup tutorial, tattoos can be covered up fairly well using products like primer, foundation, eye shadow, hair spray, concealer, and powder. Late last month, videos of Karol G’s ex-fiancé Anuel AA were posted on Instagram showing the rapper getting some of his tattoos reworked to remove all signs of Karol G.</p><h2>What is the meaning of Anuel’s tattoo?</h2><p>Tattoo: Tattoo of his and his wife Carolina’s face on the back. Meaning:<strong> Anuel’s back portrait tattoo is still unfinished.</strong> It is the portrait of the first picture they took together when nobody knew that they were even dating. She also got his name tattooed on her.</p><p>Tattoo: Elephant tattoo on his right hand. Meanings:<strong> This Indian elephant was Anuel’s first tattoo.</strong> The elephants represent<strong> fame and fortune in India.</strong> It also looks like a face when turned backward. He and his best friend got this same elephant tattoo together on the same spot. A month later, Anuel’s friend got killed.</p><p>Tattoo: Logo of Chicago bull tattoo on his right inner wrist. Meaning: This is also Anuel’s favorite tattoo, the Chicago Bull. On top of the bull’s head, it says R-I-P Jesus. It was his best friend’s name, who got killed. Anuel also got the dates of his friend’s birth and death tattooed around the Chicago bull logo.</p><p>Tattoo: Virgin Mary tattoo on his right arm. Meaning:<strong> When Anuel went to prison, he started to build a good relationship with God and prayed a lot.</strong> He also read the bible and started to get a lot of knowledge about life. That’s when he got the Virgin Mary tattoo on his arm.</p><p>Anuel started recording music at age fourteen. In 2010, he joined American rapper Rick Ross’s Maybach Music Group. His 2016 mixtape Real Hasta la Muerte was a big hit, but he went to prison for illegal firearm possession in the same year.</p><p>He then recorded the entirety of his debut album while incarcerated. Anuel released his debut album on<strong> July 17, 2018,</strong> the day he was released from prison. The album was commercially successful. In August 2019, he released the song “China”, a collaboration with Daddy Yankee, Karol G, Ozuna, and J Balvin, which was a global success. …</p><p>Anuel<strong> has all his family members’ names tattooed on his hand</strong> so he could see them all the time. Because everything he does, he does it for his family. He is also planning to add his dad’s name soon.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><h3 class=jp-relatedposts-headline>Related</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivmaC2b6%2FEpZybqpmpxm%2ByzGibopxdlru2sctmmJplk6TDpr6MoaCsZaSWwbW7zqxkamljaH16e8Cmp2g%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./andrea-russett-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Andrea Russett Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</span></a>
