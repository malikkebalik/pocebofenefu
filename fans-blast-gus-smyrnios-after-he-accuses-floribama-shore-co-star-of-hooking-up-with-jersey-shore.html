It’s unclear what Butts said that sparked the conversation in his since-deleted tweet, but Gus initially replied with some severe accusations regarding 495 Productions, the company behind&nbsp;Floribama Shore. “Shouldn’t have spread lies to ruin a friend’s reputation,” he tweeted. “And I shouldn’t have been FORCED To sleep with a cast member by production in order to give them storyline I wanted no part of and told I’d be fired if I didn’t.”&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-2><p lang=en dir=ltr>No that cast member acted like she liked me for money for a tv script.

Their back-and-forth romance was a major plot point in the reality series and is presumably who he’s talking about in these tweets.</p><p id=par-4_72>A fan replied to Gus, asking if he “led a cast member on for money.” He replied: “No that cast member acted like she liked me for money for a tv script.

However, that hasn’t stopped Gus from tweeting about his time on the show, and many fans think it needs to end. “He’s still going on about&nbsp;Floribama Shore&nbsp;drama,” said one&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Redditor</a>. “The show ended. Time to move on, Gus.”&nbsp;</p><p id=par-6_31>“So what if she hooked with Pauly and Vinny,” said another user in a different&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Reddit thread</a>. “They weren’t in a relationship… By Gus’s preference, if I recall correctly??? Good for her.”</p><p id=par-7_51><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Another Reddit user</a>&nbsp;doubted Gus’ claims, writing: “There’s no way Nilsa hooked up with either Pauly or Vinny.” Showbiz Cheat Sheet reached out to 495 Productions and representatives for Nilsa regarding these claims. We did not hear back from either party by publication but will update this article if they reach out.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-gus-and-nilsa-are-both-married-now-but-not-to-each-other>Gus and Nilsa are both married now, but not to each other&nbsp;</h2><p id=par-8_39>Both&nbsp;Floribama Shore&nbsp;stars are married now. Nilsa got married to <a href=#>Gus Gazda</a> in November 2021. <a href=#>Gus married Samantha Carucci</a> on Oct. 8, 2022. As a result, many fans wonder why Gus is still talking about his former fling with Nilsa.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-9_36>“Isn’t he married?” asked another&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Reddit user</a>. “Why is he still talking about her?”&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Another Redditor</a>&nbsp;said: “Must be real fun for his new bride to see he is still talking/thinking/obsessing about Nilsa. … Grow up and move on.”&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSzorrSZpmlmaOpeqjB0maqprGio7awv4yampyto5rAbrLLqKmimpGirm6%2Fx6ipnmWTpHq0wMCrZKGnn6C2r7OMo5yrq5WuerS0zqucZpuRqMFvtNOmo2g%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./daren-ganga-biography-age-height-wife-net-worth-family.html><span>←</span><span>Daren Ganga Biography, Age, Height, Wife, Net Worth, Family</span></a>
