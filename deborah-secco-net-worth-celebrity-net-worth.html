Born November 26, 1979 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, she debuted at just 8 years old in TV advertising and at age 10 appeared in her first TV show, Brincando de Era uma Vez. At age 11, she starred in her first soap opera, Mico Preto by Rede Globo. In 1999, she appeared in the novela Suave Veneno. In August of that same year, she posed for the first time for the Brazilian edition of Playboy magazine in the 24th anniversary edition. In 2000, she played her first villain in a novela, as the rebel Iris in La√ßos de Fam√≠lia and in 2001 gained her first protagonist role as Cecilia in the novela A Padroeira. In 2002, she played yet another TV villain-the comical and clumsy vampire Lara, in the novela O Beijo do Vampiro.</p><p>That year, her character was voted the most beloved character in a novela by viewers. Due to the sensual appeal and prominence in the novela and the success of Lara, Secco appeared on the cover of Playboy for the 27th birthday edition of the magazine in August that year. In 2003, she joined the cast of the novela Celebridade and in 2005 she played her first prime-time role in Am√©rica as Sol, a woman trying to make a living in the United States as an illegal immigrant. In 2010, she starred in the series As Cariocas, as Alice, the penultimate protagonist of the series. In 2011, she was cast as a former prostitute in Bruna Surfistinha and later that year she played one of the protagonists in the novela Insensato Cora√ß√£o. According to an article in the national political magazine, Veja, the actress was convicted of embezzlement of public funds, along with others involved, and ordered to repay a substantial sum of monies to public coffers.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR7wJyrqKqjZLGmrs6rmKFlo5qwpLuMp5ytZaekv7W0jg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kevin-smith-extolls-the-joys-of-pot-smoking.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Kevin Smith extolls the joys of pot smoking</span></a>
