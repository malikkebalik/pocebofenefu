The actor was filming </span><span>The Mountain B</span>etween Us <span>in Vancouver, Canada, when he met Sabrina, a Somali-Canadian model. While Idris once said <a href=#>he never wanted to marry again</a>, he couldn’t help himself. After a public proposal, the couple had a three-day wedding in Morocco,</span> where they celebrated their African heritage.</p><p id=par-3_50>In addition to his wife, <a href=#>Idris has three children</a>. He shares his daughter, Isan Elba, 22, with his ex-wife, Hanne “Kim” Nørgaard. He shares his son, Winston Elba, 10, with his ex-girlfriend, Naiyana Garth. Idris also has an older son, 32, who he prefers to keep out of the spotlight.</p><p id=par-4_38>Isan loves the spotlight and desires to sustain a Hollywood career as an adult. “I’ve always been a lover of TV and movies, and I dream to be in the industry one day,” Isan said, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">People</a>.</p><p id=par-5_56>It looks like Sabrina and Isan get along very well. The stepmom and stepdaughter attended the women’s semi-final day at the&nbsp;Wimbledon&nbsp;Championships&nbsp;on Thursday, July 11, 2024. Sabrina wore white linen pants paired with a relaxed white top and black sandals, while Isan chose a mesh white cami, relaxed dark denim jeans, a black blazer, and white heels.</p><p id=par-6_26>Sabrina and Isan reportedly looked like they were having a great time as they laughed with friends and posed with other famous faces, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">DailyMail.com</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-sabrina-elba-said-she-feels-like-idris-elba-s-daughter-is-her-best-friend>Sabrina Elba said she feels like Idris Elba’s daughter is her ‘best friend’</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Isan-Elba-Sabrina-Elba-1.webp?strip=all&quality=80"><p id=par-7_31>Sabrina Elba doesn’t have any biological children. <span>On <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">How to Fail With Elizabeth Day</a>, she discussed how she always wanted kids </span>and her experience becoming a stepmother to Idris Elba’s children.</p><p id=par-8_43>“I was like, this is a lot. I’m not just going to now add to this equation. Hold on a second. I wanted to explore that. I wanted to feel what it was like. And I’m so thankful; they are the best children.”</p><p id=par-9_77>Sabrina added that she feels “so, so close” to Idris’s kids. “Me and Isan, who’s 22 now, I feel like she’s one of my little best friends,” she continued. “She’s so cool and so inspiring. I love watching her grow and develop. I felt like, OK, I have a duty here, and I have a responsibility now as a stepmom. You know, it’s a bit of a thankless job. But I wanted to do right by it.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-idris-elba-says-he-s-conscious-of-his-daughter-s-space-but-loves-to-dote-on-his-kids>Idris Elba says he’s ‘conscious’ of his ‘daughter’s space’ but loves to dote on his kids</h2><p id=par-10_28>Idris Elba adores being a dad. “Being witness to the birth of my children, happy and healthy, is the biggest, biggest, most best thing ever,” he told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">People</a>.</p><p id=par-11_20>Idris added that he’s embarrassed his kids before, as he’s “super doting,” but he remains “conscious” of his daughter.</p><p id=par-12_53>“I tend to be conscious of my daughter’s space,” he said. “I’m super doting as a dad. Big hugs, kisses, lots of love-yous and all of that. I’m sure my daughter’s like, ‘All right, Dad, chill out.’ My son, he gets it. But he’s still at that age where he loves a cuddle.”</p><p id=par-13_45>Idris noted that his kids “overthink” everything, much like himself. “Sabrina and I have a joke, ‘What’s the backstory?’ Because I’m always asking. ‘There’s no backstory. The pizza’s late.’ ‘But why? What’s he doing?’ And my children share that trait,” he continued. “We just over-analyze.”</p><p id=par-14_13>For more on the entertainment world and exclusive interviews, follow&nbsp;<a href=#>Showbiz Cheat Sheet’s Instagram</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS2pb7IrGSepJKWwG7DyJ%2BcZpyRqrSpwMSrZKWnn6B6rbXKnmSsoaOpsrO%2FjLCgppqcmrGwuoysnJ5loJ28tbvSZ5%2BtpZxk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./after-testing-positive-for-coronavirus-rudy-gobert-donated-500-000-to-employee-and-social-services.html><span>←</span><span>After Testing Positive For Coronavirus, Rudy Gobert Donated $500,000 To Employee And Social Services</span></a>
